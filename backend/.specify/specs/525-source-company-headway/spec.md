## 1. Problem Statement

Headway operates a national mental-healthcare network that makes
therapy and psychiatry accessible and affordable through insurance,
connecting patients with in-network providers while handling billing
and credentialing.

Headway publishes its careers board through Greenhouse at
the bare slug `headway`. The run-398 batch sweep confirmed
65 live role(s) via a direct probe of
`https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/headway/jobs?content=true`.
Sector: Digital Health / Mental Health. HQ: New York, New York, USA.

## 2. Goals

- Ship a `source-company-headway` plugin returning live
  `JobPostDto` rows from the Greenhouse board.
- Mirror the canonical variant-2 + D-08 company-direct template
  (wire `company_name` pass-through; defensive title/department
  trim; entity-decode-then-tag-strip descriptions).
- Bundle a unit-test suite (≥ 9 cases) with a mocked HTTP fixture.
- Publish the plugin's `Module` in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Authenticated Greenhouse Harvest API support.
- Backfilling historical Headway postings.
- Cross-board enrichment or salary inference.

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **aggregator caller**, I want **`Site.HEADWAY`** in the
> source registry, so that **a single `siteType: [Site.HEADWAY]`
> request returns Headway's open roles**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                 | Priority |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | Add `Site.HEADWAY = 'headway'` to the `Site` enum.               | must     |
| FR-2  | New plugin package `@ever-jobs/source-company-headway`.                  | must     |
| FR-3  | `HeadwayService.scrape(input)` returns a `JobResponseDto`; never throws. | must   |
| FR-4  | The plugin is registered in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.                          | must     |
| FR-5  | `tsconfig.base.json` path-alias + matching `jest.config.js` mapper.      | must     |
| FR-6  | Each `JobPostDto` `id` prefixed `headway-`, `site === Site.HEADWAY`. | must |
| FR-7  | `input.resultsWanted` honoured.                                           | must     |
| FR-8  | `input.searchTerm` honoured (title + department substring).               | should   |
| FR-9  | Network errors caught — returns `{ jobs: [] }`.                            | must     |
| FR-10 | ≥ 9 unit tests with mocked HTTP.                                            | must     |
| FR-11 | D-08 decode-then-strip pipeline.                                            | must     |
| FR-12 | Wire `absolute_url` flows through to `jobUrl` (variant 2).               | must     |
| FR-13 | D-10 defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.                                   | must     |
| FR-14 | D-11 defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.                         | must     |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1..NFR-4 — same as cohort baseline (no new runtime deps;
`Promise`-based async; `Logger` not `console`; resilient to
malformed payloads).

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
@SourcePlugin({ site: Site.HEADWAY, name: 'Headway', category: 'company' })
@Injectable()
export class HeadwayService implements IScraper {
  scrape(input: ScraperInputDto): Promise<JobResponseDto>;
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

All transport errors swallowed; caller sees `{ jobs: [] }`.

## 8. Test Plan

- ≥ 9 cases. Happy-path asserts variant-2 URL pass-through
  (`job-boards.greenhouse.io/headway/jobs/<id>`), wire
  `company_name` pass-through (`'Headway'`),
  D-10 title-trim lock, D-11 department-trim lock, and the
  D-08 decode-then-strip regression guard.
- Plus standard cohort cases (resultsWanted cap, searchTerm
  match + non-match, HTTP 500 error handling, empty payload).

## 9. Open Questions

(none open — see § 10 Decisions.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-04 (run #398):** Wire-shape variant 2 (canonical hosted-board
  host `job-boards.greenhouse.io/headway/jobs/<id>`).
- **D-08 (run #398):** Decode-then-strip description pipeline.
- **D-09 (run #398):** Wire `company_name` pass-through
  (`'Headway'`).
- **D-10 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.
- **D-11 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.
