## 1. Problem Statement

AGE Solutions LLC is a technology and professional services company
serving U.S. government, defense, and intelligence customers. Its
work spans network engineering, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and
enterprise audiovisual and video teleconferencing (AV/VTC) systems
delivered under federal contracts. Open roles for AV engineers,
cable technicians, and related field staff are concentrated at
military and government sites in the Washington, DC metro area and
around the country, where positions are often contingent on contract
award and government clearance.

AGE Solutions publishes its careers board through Greenhouse at
the bare slug `agecareers`. The run-398 batch sweep confirmed
61 live role(s) via a direct probe of
`https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/agecareers/jobs?content=true`.
Sector: Government IT and professional services. HQ: Alexandria, VA, USA.

## 2. Goals

- Ship a `source-company-agecareers` plugin returning live
  `JobPostDto` rows from the Greenhouse board.
- Mirror the canonical variant-2 + D-08 company-direct template
  (wire `company_name` pass-through; defensive title/department
  trim; entity-decode-then-tag-strip descriptions).
- Bundle a unit-test suite (≥ 9 cases) with a mocked HTTP fixture.
- Publish the plugin's `Module` in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Authenticated Greenhouse Harvest API support.
- Backfilling historical AGE Solutions postings.
- Cross-board enrichment or salary inference.

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **aggregator caller**, I want **`Site.AGECAREERS`** in the
> source registry, so that **a single `siteType: [Site.AGECAREERS]`
> request returns AGE Solutions's open roles**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                 | Priority |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | Add `Site.AGECAREERS = 'agecareers'` to the `Site` enum.               | must     |
| FR-2  | New plugin package `@ever-jobs/source-company-agecareers`.                  | must     |
| FR-3  | `AgecareersService.scrape(input)` returns a `JobResponseDto`; never throws. | must   |
| FR-4  | The plugin is registered in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.                          | must     |
| FR-5  | `tsconfig.base.json` path-alias + matching `jest.config.js` mapper.      | must     |
| FR-6  | Each `JobPostDto` `id` prefixed `agecareers-`, `site === Site.AGECAREERS`. | must |
| FR-7  | `input.resultsWanted` honoured.                                           | must     |
| FR-8  | `input.searchTerm` honoured (title + department substring).               | should   |
| FR-9  | Network errors caught — returns `{ jobs: [] }`.                            | must     |
| FR-10 | ≥ 9 unit tests with mocked HTTP.                                            | must     |
| FR-11 | D-08 decode-then-strip pipeline.                                            | must     |
| FR-12 | Wire `absolute_url` flows through to `jobUrl` (variant 2).               | must     |
| FR-13 | D-10 defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.                                   | must     |
| FR-14 | D-11 defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.                         | must     |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1..NFR-4 — same as cohort baseline (no new runtime deps;
`Promise`-based async; `Logger` not `console`; resilient to
malformed payloads).

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
@SourcePlugin({ site: Site.AGECAREERS, name: 'AGE Solutions', category: 'company' })
@Injectable()
export class AgecareersService implements IScraper {
  scrape(input: ScraperInputDto): Promise<JobResponseDto>;
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

All transport errors swallowed; caller sees `{ jobs: [] }`.

## 8. Test Plan

- ≥ 9 cases. Happy-path asserts variant-2 URL pass-through
  (`job-boards.greenhouse.io/agecareers/jobs/<id>`), wire
  `company_name` pass-through (`'AGE Solutions'`),
  D-10 title-trim lock, D-11 department-trim lock, and the
  D-08 decode-then-strip regression guard.
- Plus standard cohort cases (resultsWanted cap, searchTerm
  match + non-match, HTTP 500 error handling, empty payload).

## 9. Open Questions

(none open — see § 10 Decisions.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-04 (run #398):** Wire-shape variant 2 (canonical hosted-board
  host `job-boards.greenhouse.io/agecareers/jobs/<id>`).
- **D-08 (run #398):** Decode-then-strip description pipeline.
- **D-09 (run #398):** Wire `company_name` pass-through
  (`'AGE Solutions'`).
- **D-10 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.
- **D-11 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.
