## 1. Problem Statement

AlphaGrep Securities is a quantitative proprietary trading and
investment firm founded in 2009 and headquartered in Mumbai, India.
It develops and executes algorithmic trading strategies and acts as
a market maker across multiple asset classes on exchanges worldwide,
with an emphasis on low-latency systems, mathematics, and
statistics. The firm employs engineers, computer scientists,
mathematicians, statisticians, and physicists across offices in
Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Open roles span quantitative
research and trading, core engineering, systems and network
infrastructure, risk, and operations.

AlphaGrep Securities publishes its careers board through Greenhouse at
the bare slug `alphagrepsecurities`. The run-398 batch sweep confirmed
23 live role(s) via a direct probe of
`https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/alphagrepsecurities/jobs?content=true`.
Sector: Quantitative Trading / Financial Services. HQ: Mumbai, India.

## 2. Goals

- Ship a `source-company-alphagrepsecurities` plugin returning live
  `JobPostDto` rows from the Greenhouse board.
- Mirror the canonical variant-2 + D-08 company-direct template
  (wire `company_name` pass-through; defensive title/department
  trim; entity-decode-then-tag-strip descriptions).
- Bundle a unit-test suite (≥ 9 cases) with a mocked HTTP fixture.
- Publish the plugin's `Module` in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Authenticated Greenhouse Harvest API support.
- Backfilling historical AlphaGrep Securities postings.
- Cross-board enrichment or salary inference.

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **aggregator caller**, I want **`Site.ALPHAGREPSECURITIES`** in the
> source registry, so that **a single `siteType: [Site.ALPHAGREPSECURITIES]`
> request returns AlphaGrep Securities's open roles**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                 | Priority |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | Add `Site.ALPHAGREPSECURITIES = 'alphagrepsecurities'` to the `Site` enum.               | must     |
| FR-2  | New plugin package `@ever-jobs/source-company-alphagrepsecurities`.                  | must     |
| FR-3  | `AlphagrepsecuritiesService.scrape(input)` returns a `JobResponseDto`; never throws. | must   |
| FR-4  | The plugin is registered in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.                          | must     |
| FR-5  | `tsconfig.base.json` path-alias + matching `jest.config.js` mapper.      | must     |
| FR-6  | Each `JobPostDto` `id` prefixed `alphagrepsecurities-`, `site === Site.ALPHAGREPSECURITIES`. | must |
| FR-7  | `input.resultsWanted` honoured.                                           | must     |
| FR-8  | `input.searchTerm` honoured (title + department substring).               | should   |
| FR-9  | Network errors caught — returns `{ jobs: [] }`.                            | must     |
| FR-10 | ≥ 9 unit tests with mocked HTTP.                                            | must     |
| FR-11 | D-08 decode-then-strip pipeline.                                            | must     |
| FR-12 | Wire `absolute_url` flows through to `jobUrl` (variant 2).               | must     |
| FR-13 | D-10 defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.                                   | must     |
| FR-14 | D-11 defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.                         | must     |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1..NFR-4 — same as cohort baseline (no new runtime deps;
`Promise`-based async; `Logger` not `console`; resilient to
malformed payloads).

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
@SourcePlugin({ site: Site.ALPHAGREPSECURITIES, name: 'AlphaGrep Securities', category: 'company' })
@Injectable()
export class AlphagrepsecuritiesService implements IScraper {
  scrape(input: ScraperInputDto): Promise<JobResponseDto>;
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

All transport errors swallowed; caller sees `{ jobs: [] }`.

## 8. Test Plan

- ≥ 9 cases. Happy-path asserts variant-2 URL pass-through
  (`job-boards.greenhouse.io/alphagrepsecurities/jobs/<id>`), wire
  `company_name` pass-through (`'AlphaGrep Securities'`),
  D-10 title-trim lock, D-11 department-trim lock, and the
  D-08 decode-then-strip regression guard.
- Plus standard cohort cases (resultsWanted cap, searchTerm
  match + non-match, HTTP 500 error handling, empty payload).

## 9. Open Questions

(none open — see § 10 Decisions.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-04 (run #398):** Wire-shape variant 2 (canonical hosted-board
  host `job-boards.greenhouse.io/alphagrepsecurities/jobs/<id>`).
- **D-08 (run #398):** Decode-then-strip description pipeline.
- **D-09 (run #398):** Wire `company_name` pass-through
  (`'AlphaGrep Securities'`).
- **D-10 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.
- **D-11 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.
