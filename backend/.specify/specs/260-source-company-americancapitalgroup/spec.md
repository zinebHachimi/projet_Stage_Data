## 1. Problem Statement

American Capital Group is a privately owned, vertically integrated
real estate company based in Bellevue, Washington, focused on the
design, development, construction, and management of multifamily
residential communities. It operates an in-house construction arm
under the American Home Builders name and develops apartment
communities across western U.S. markets. Hiring signals point to
architecture, design, and construction project management roles in
the Pacific Northwest.

American Capital Group publishes its careers board through Greenhouse at
the bare slug `americancapitalgroup`. The run-398 batch sweep confirmed
9 live role(s) via a direct probe of
`https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/americancapitalgroup/jobs?content=true`.
Sector: Real Estate Development & Construction. HQ: Bellevue, WA, USA.

## 2. Goals

- Ship a `source-company-americancapitalgroup` plugin returning live
  `JobPostDto` rows from the Greenhouse board.
- Mirror the canonical variant-2 + D-08 company-direct template
  (wire `company_name` pass-through; defensive title/department
  trim; entity-decode-then-tag-strip descriptions).
- Bundle a unit-test suite (≥ 9 cases) with a mocked HTTP fixture.
- Publish the plugin's `Module` in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Authenticated Greenhouse Harvest API support.
- Backfilling historical American Capital Group postings.
- Cross-board enrichment or salary inference.

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **aggregator caller**, I want **`Site.AMERICANCAPITALGROUP`** in the
> source registry, so that **a single `siteType: [Site.AMERICANCAPITALGROUP]`
> request returns American Capital Group's open roles**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                 | Priority |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | Add `Site.AMERICANCAPITALGROUP = 'americancapitalgroup'` to the `Site` enum.               | must     |
| FR-2  | New plugin package `@ever-jobs/source-company-americancapitalgroup`.                  | must     |
| FR-3  | `AmericancapitalgroupService.scrape(input)` returns a `JobResponseDto`; never throws. | must   |
| FR-4  | The plugin is registered in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.                          | must     |
| FR-5  | `tsconfig.base.json` path-alias + matching `jest.config.js` mapper.      | must     |
| FR-6  | Each `JobPostDto` `id` prefixed `americancapitalgroup-`, `site === Site.AMERICANCAPITALGROUP`. | must |
| FR-7  | `input.resultsWanted` honoured.                                           | must     |
| FR-8  | `input.searchTerm` honoured (title + department substring).               | should   |
| FR-9  | Network errors caught — returns `{ jobs: [] }`.                            | must     |
| FR-10 | ≥ 9 unit tests with mocked HTTP.                                            | must     |
| FR-11 | D-08 decode-then-strip pipeline.                                            | must     |
| FR-12 | Wire `absolute_url` flows through to `jobUrl` (variant 2).               | must     |
| FR-13 | D-10 defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.                                   | must     |
| FR-14 | D-11 defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.                         | must     |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1..NFR-4 — same as cohort baseline (no new runtime deps;
`Promise`-based async; `Logger` not `console`; resilient to
malformed payloads).

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
@SourcePlugin({ site: Site.AMERICANCAPITALGROUP, name: 'American Capital Group', category: 'company' })
@Injectable()
export class AmericancapitalgroupService implements IScraper {
  scrape(input: ScraperInputDto): Promise<JobResponseDto>;
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

All transport errors swallowed; caller sees `{ jobs: [] }`.

## 8. Test Plan

- ≥ 9 cases. Happy-path asserts variant-2 URL pass-through
  (`job-boards.greenhouse.io/americancapitalgroup/jobs/<id>`), wire
  `company_name` pass-through (`'American Capital Group'`),
  D-10 title-trim lock, D-11 department-trim lock, and the
  D-08 decode-then-strip regression guard.
- Plus standard cohort cases (resultsWanted cap, searchTerm
  match + non-match, HTTP 500 error handling, empty payload).

## 9. Open Questions

(none open — see § 10 Decisions.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-04 (run #398):** Wire-shape variant 2 (canonical hosted-board
  host `job-boards.greenhouse.io/americancapitalgroup/jobs/<id>`).
- **D-08 (run #398):** Decode-then-strip description pipeline.
- **D-09 (run #398):** Wire `company_name` pass-through
  (`'American Capital Group'`).
- **D-10 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.
- **D-11 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.
