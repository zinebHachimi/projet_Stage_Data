/**
 * Deloitte — Global professional services network providing audit, tax, consulting, risk and advisory services.
 *
 * Deloitte is one of the largest global professional services organizations,
 * delivering audit and assurance, tax and legal, consulting, and risk and
 * financial advisory services. It operates through member firms across
 * numerous countries. This SmartRecruiters board hosts postings including
 * graduate and consulting recruitment across regions.
 *
 * Sector: Professional services / consulting. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Deloitte6`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Deloitte6`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
