/**
 * Cardinal Logistics — US dedicated trucking and transportation logistics provider.
 *
 * Cardinal Logistics is a US-based transportation and logistics company
 * headquartered in Concord, North Carolina. It operates one of the country's
 * larger dedicated fleets, providing dedicated contract carriage, freight
 * brokerage, and supply chain services throughout the United States.
 *
 * Sector: Logistics & Trucking. HQ: Concord, North Carolina, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CardinalLogistics1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CardinalLogistics1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
