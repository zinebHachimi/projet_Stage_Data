/**
 * Lucky Cart — MarTech / retail-media platform activating first-party transaction data into personalized shopper offers.
 *
 * SAS Lucky Cart is a French MarTech company that combines first-party
 * transaction data with retail-media capabilities, analyzing point-of-sale
 * data from retailers to build shopper profiles and activate personalized
 * offers in real time. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at
 * luckycart.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: MarTech / Retail media. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `luckycart`
 * (`https://luckycart.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
