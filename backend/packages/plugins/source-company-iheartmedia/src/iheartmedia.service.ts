/**
 * iHeartMedia — US audio and radio broadcasting media company.
 *
 * iHeartMedia is an audio media company that operates broadcast radio
 * stations, digital audio and podcast platforms in the United States. It
 * hires across sales, broadcasting, digital and corporate roles.
 *
 * Sector: Media & Broadcasting. HQ: San Antonio, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `IHeartMedia`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/IHeartMedia`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
