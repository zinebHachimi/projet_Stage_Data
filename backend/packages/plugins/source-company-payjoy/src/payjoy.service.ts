/**
 * PayJoy — Point-of-sale financing and credit provider for under-served customers in emerging markets.
 *
 * PayJoy provides point-of-sale financing and card products to under-served
 * consumers in emerging markets, using patented secured-credit technology
 * alongside machine learning and anti-fraud systems.
 *
 * Sector: Consumer Lending / Fintech. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `payjoy`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/payjoy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
