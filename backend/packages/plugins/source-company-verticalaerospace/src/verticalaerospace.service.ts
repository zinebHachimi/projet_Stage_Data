/**
 * Vertical Aerospace — Develops the VX4 electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.
 *
 * Vertical Aerospace is a UK aerospace company developing the VX4, a piloted
 * electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. The company works across
 * advanced software, systems safety, and digital manufacturing engineering.
 * It is pursuing certification of its aircraft for advanced air mobility.
 *
 * Sector: Aerospace (eVTOL). HQ: Bristol, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `vertical-aerospace`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/vertical-aerospace`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
