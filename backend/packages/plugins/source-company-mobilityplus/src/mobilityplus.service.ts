/**
 * MobilityPlus — Belgian EV-charging software and infrastructure provider.
 *
 * MobilityPlus is a Ghent-based Belgian EV-charging software and
 * infrastructure company. Its Recruitee board at mobilityplus.recruitee.com
 * listed 6 offers based in Gent, including a Data & BI Engineer and
 * partnership/roaming manager roles.
 *
 * Sector: Software / EV charging. HQ: Ghent, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `mobilityplus`
 * (`https://mobilityplus.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
