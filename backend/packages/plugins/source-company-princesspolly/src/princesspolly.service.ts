/**
 * Princess Polly — Online women\'s fashion brand with a growing US retail footprint.
 *
 * Princess Polly is an online women's fashion retailer with corporate
 * offices in Los Angeles and Australia's Gold Coast. It operates a
 * direct-to-consumer e-commerce business alongside physical retail stores
 * across the US and Australia.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / Fashion e-commerce. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `princesspolly`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/princesspolly`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
