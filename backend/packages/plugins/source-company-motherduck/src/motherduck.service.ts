/**
 * MotherDuck — Cloud data warehouse built on DuckDB for developers and data practitioners.
 *
 * MotherDuck builds a cloud-hosted data warehouse based on the open-source
 * DuckDB analytical database, aimed at developers and data practitioners. It
 * combines local and cloud execution. The company hires across Sales,
 * Engineering, and Customer Success in San Francisco, Seattle, New York
 * City, and Amsterdam.
 *
 * Sector: Databases / Data Warehouse. HQ: Seattle, Washington, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `motherduck`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/motherduck`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
