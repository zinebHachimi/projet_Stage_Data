/**
 * Taptap Send — A cross-border money transfer app focused on emerging markets.
 *
 * Taptap Send is a cross-border remittance company that enables people to
 * send money internationally, with a focus on emerging markets. It operates
 * across multiple continents and is exploring stablecoin-based money
 * movement.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Cross-border remittance. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `taptapsend`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/taptapsend`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
