/**
 * OnePay — An all-in-one consumer financial services app spanning banking, savings, credit, and more.
 *
 * OnePay is a consumer financial services platform that brings together
 * banking, high-yield savings, credit cards, point-of-sale lending,
 * investing, and crypto in a single app. It partners with employers, HCM
 * providers, and gig platforms.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Consumer financial services. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `oneapp`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/oneapp`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
