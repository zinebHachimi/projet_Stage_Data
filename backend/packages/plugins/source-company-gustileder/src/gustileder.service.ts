/**
 * Gusti Leder — E-commerce retailer of leather bags, accessories and goods selling internationally via its own shop and marketplaces.
 *
 * Gusti Leder GmbH is a German e-commerce company selling leather bags,
 * backpacks and accessories through its own online shop and third-party
 * marketplaces including Zalando. Its Recruitee board
 * (gustileder.recruitee.com) returned a JSON offers array including roles
 * such as 'Customer Support Agent', 'Country Manager (m/w/d)' and an
 * 'E-Commerce Assistant (Zalando)' remote position.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce (leather goods / fashion accessories). HQ: Rostock, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `gustileder`
 * (`https://gustileder.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
