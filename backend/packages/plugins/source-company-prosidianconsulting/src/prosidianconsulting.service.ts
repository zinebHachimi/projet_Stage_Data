/**
 * ProSidian Consulting — Management and operations consulting firm serving government and commercial clients.
 *
 * ProSidian Consulting is a management and operations consulting services
 * firm providing solutions in risk management, compliance, business process,
 * IT effectiveness, engineering, environmental, sustainability and human
 * capital. It serves federal government and commercial clients across the
 * United States.
 *
 * Sector: Management and operations consulting. HQ: Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `prosidianconsulting`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/prosidianconsulting`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
