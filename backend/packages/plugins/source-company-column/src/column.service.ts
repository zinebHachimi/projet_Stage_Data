/**
 * Column — A nationally chartered bank built for developers and builders.
 *
 * Column is a bank and software company that provides technology-forward
 * banking infrastructure for developers and builders, covering banking
 * products, payments, and credit. It offers direct access to banking rails
 * for fintech companies.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Banking infrastructure. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `column`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/column`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
