/**
 * SentiLink — Provides real-time identity verification and fraud-detection APIs, primarily for financial institutions.
 *
 * SentiLink builds identity and risk solutions that help institutions verify
 * identities and detect synthetic identity fraud in real time. Its APIs are
 * used across financial services and are expanding into additional markets.
 * The company is backed by investors including Craft Ventures, Andreessen
 * Horowitz, and NYCA.
 *
 * Sector: Fraud & Identity. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sentilink`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sentilink`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
