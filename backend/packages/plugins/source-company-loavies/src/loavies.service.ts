/**
 * LOAVIES — Direct-to-consumer online fashion brand with frequent new-product drops selling across European markets.
 *
 * LOAVIES is a Dutch direct-to-consumer online fashion brand (founded 2012)
 * that releases frequent new collections and sells across several European
 * markets, per its careers copy citing over one million active customers.
 * Its HQ is in Zwolle, with retail activity in Utrecht. The Recruitee board
 * loavies.recruitee.com returned 10 live offers spanning merchandising,
 * social/content, retail, customer service, styling and influencer
 * marketing.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce retail (D2C fashion). HQ: Zwolle, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `loavies`
 * (`https://loavies.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
