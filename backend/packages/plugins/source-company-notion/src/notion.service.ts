/**
 * Notion — Connected workspace combining notes, docs, wikis, databases, and project management.
 *
 * Notion is a productivity software company that builds a single connected
 * workspace for notes, documents, wikis, databases, and project and task
 * management. It also offers Notion AI and Notion Calendar within the same
 * product suite. The company is headquartered in San Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: Productivity & collaboration software. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `notion`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/notion`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
