/**
 * Sardine — Risk platform for fraud prevention, compliance, and financial-crime detection.
 *
 * Sardine provides a risk platform that unifies data across fraud,
 * compliance, and risk teams to detect and stop financial crime in real time
 * and automate fraud and AML operations. Customers include companies such as
 * FIS, GoDaddy, and Checkout.com.
 *
 * Sector: Fraud & Risk. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sardine`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sardine`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
