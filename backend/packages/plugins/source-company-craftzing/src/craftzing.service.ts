/**
 * Craftzing — Digital product and transformation agency (engineering, design, strategy).
 *
 * Craftzing is a Belgian digital product and transformation agency operating
 * from Antwerp, Ghent, and Leuven. Its Recruitee board at
 * craftzing.recruitee.com listed 10 offers including solution architects, a
 * front-end Vue developer, and program/project managers.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Digital agency. HQ: Antwerp / Ghent, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `craftzing`
 * (`https://craftzing.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
