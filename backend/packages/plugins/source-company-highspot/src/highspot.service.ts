/**
 * Highspot — Sales enablement platform for content management, training, and buyer engagement.
 *
 * Highspot provides a sales enablement platform that manages sales content,
 * guides reps through plays, and analyzes buyer engagement. It sells to
 * enterprise revenue teams and has engineering in Seattle and Hyderabad.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Sales Enablement. HQ: Seattle, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `highspot`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/highspot`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
