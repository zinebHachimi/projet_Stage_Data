/**
 * Bluecrux — Supply-chain consulting and value-chain software (Binocs, Axon).
 *
 * Bluecrux is a Belgian supply-chain consultancy and software company
 * (products include Binocs and Axon) serving value-chain optimization for
 * enterprises. Its Recruitee board at bluecrux.recruitee.com listed 5 offers
 * spanning Belgium, the US, and Ireland.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Supply-chain consulting. HQ: Aalst, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `bluecrux`
 * (`https://bluecrux.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
