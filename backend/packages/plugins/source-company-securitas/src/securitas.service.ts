/**
 * Securitas — Swedish multinational providing protective and security services.
 *
 * Securitas AB is a Swedish multinational security-services company
 * headquartered in Stockholm. It provides on-site guarding, mobile and
 * monitoring services, and technology-driven and risk-management security
 * solutions across many countries, and is publicly listed in Sweden.
 *
 * Sector: Security services. HQ: Stockholm, Sweden.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Securitas`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Securitas`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
