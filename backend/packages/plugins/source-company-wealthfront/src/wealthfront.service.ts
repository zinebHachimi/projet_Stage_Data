/**
 * Wealthfront — Automated investing and cash-management platform for retail investors.
 *
 * Wealthfront provides automated investment management, cash accounts, and
 * financial-planning products aimed at helping retail investors grow and
 * manage their money at low cost.
 *
 * Sector: Wealth Management / Fintech. HQ: Palo Alto, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `wealthfront`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/wealthfront`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
