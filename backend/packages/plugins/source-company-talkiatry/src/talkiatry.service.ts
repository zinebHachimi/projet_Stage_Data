/**
 * Talkiatry — National psychiatry practice delivering in-network virtual mental health care.
 *
 * Talkiatry is a mental health care company that provides psychiatry and
 * therapy through a nationwide network of employed clinicians. It focuses on
 * in-network, insurance-based care delivered virtually. Patients complete an
 * online assessment to be matched with a psychiatrist.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (mental health / telepsychiatry). HQ: New York, NY, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `talkiatry`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/talkiatry`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
