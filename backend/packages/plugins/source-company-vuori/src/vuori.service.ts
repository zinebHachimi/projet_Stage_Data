/**
 * Vuori — Performance apparel brand selling activewear and athleisure through its own stores and e-commerce.
 *
 * Vuori is a California-based apparel company that designs and sells
 * activewear and athleisure for men and women. It operates a
 * direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel alongside a growing fleet of
 * physical retail stores in the US and internationally. Product lines span
 * training, running, and everyday casual wear.
 *
 * Sector: Apparel & activewear (retail/e-commerce). HQ: Carlsbad, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `VuoriInc`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/VuoriInc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
