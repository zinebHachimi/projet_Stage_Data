/**
 * Rebuy — Personalization and merchandising platform for Shopify e-commerce brands.
 *
 * Rebuy provides a personalization and intelligent merchandising platform
 * for direct-to-consumer brands, with a focus on the Shopify ecosystem. Its
 * tools power product recommendations, upsells, and personalized shopping
 * experiences. The company hosts its careers page on Ashby.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce tech / personalization. HQ: Steamboat Springs, Colorado, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `rebuy`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/rebuy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
