/**
 * Lotus Health — Combines medical records, AI, and physicians to provide personalized health guidance.
 *
 * Lotus Health provides a service that combines a user's medical records
 * with AI and real physicians to deliver personalized healthcare guidance.
 * It aims to make personalized health support broadly accessible. The
 * company hires across engineering and clinical functions.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (healthcare AI). HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `lotushealth`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/lotushealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
