/**
 * Xplor Technologies — Provider of vertical software and embedded payments for businesses.
 *
 * Xplor Technologies builds vertical-market software and embedded payment
 * solutions for industries such as fitness, recreation, field services, and
 * education. It combines business management software with integrated
 * payment processing. It serves businesses across many countries.
 *
 * Sector: Vertical SaaS and embedded payments software. HQ: Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Xplor`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Xplor`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
