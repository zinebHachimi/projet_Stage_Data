/**
 * High Tech High — Network of public charter schools in San Diego County.
 *
 * High Tech High is a network of public charter schools serving grades K-12
 * across San Diego County, known for project-based learning. It hires
 * teachers across grade levels.
 *
 * Sector: education. HQ: San Diego, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `hightechhigh`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/hightechhigh`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
