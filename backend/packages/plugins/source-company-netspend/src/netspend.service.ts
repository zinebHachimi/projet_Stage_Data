/**
 * Netspend — A provider of prepaid and debit card financial services for consumers.
 *
 * Netspend provides prepaid and debit card products and related financial
 * services aimed at consumers, including those underserved by traditional
 * banks. It manages debit and prepaid card portfolios.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Prepaid & debit cards. HQ: Austin, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `netspend-careers-page`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/netspend-careers-page`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
