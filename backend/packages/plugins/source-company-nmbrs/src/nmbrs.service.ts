/**
 * Nmbrs — Cloud HR and payroll software for accountants and businesses.
 *
 * Nmbrs is an Amsterdam-based scale-up providing cloud HR and payroll
 * software used by accountants and businesses to manage payroll and HR
 * administration. It hires across sales, implementation, data, and product
 * roles.
 *
 * Sector: HR / payroll SaaS. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `nmbrs`
 * (`https://nmbrs.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
