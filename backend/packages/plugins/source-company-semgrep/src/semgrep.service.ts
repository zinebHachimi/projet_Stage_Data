/**
 * Semgrep — Code and application security platform built on static analysis.
 *
 * Semgrep develops a static-analysis-based platform for application
 * security, enabling teams to scan code for security vulnerabilities and
 * enforce secure coding standards. It offers both open-source and commercial
 * products for developers and security teams.
 *
 * Sector: Application Security. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `semgrep`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/semgrep`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
