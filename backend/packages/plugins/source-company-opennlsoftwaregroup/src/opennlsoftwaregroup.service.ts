/**
 * OPEN.nl Software Group — Software group building enterprise content management (ECM) and related business software.
 *
 * OPEN.nl Software Group is an Amersfoort-based software group building
 * enterprise content management and related business software, hiring
 * developers, consultants, product managers, and support staff in the
 * Netherlands.
 *
 * Sector: Enterprise software / ECM. HQ: Amersfoort, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `opennl`
 * (`https://opennl.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
