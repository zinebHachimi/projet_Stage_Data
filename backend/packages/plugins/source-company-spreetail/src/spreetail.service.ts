/**
 * Spreetail — E-commerce accelerator that grows brands\' market share across online marketplaces.
 *
 * Spreetail is an e-commerce company that partners with brands to sell and
 * fulfill products across marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, and
 * TikTok Shop. It operates fulfillment, inventory, and transportation
 * operations across the US, Europe, and the Philippines.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce. HQ: Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `spreetail`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/spreetail`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
