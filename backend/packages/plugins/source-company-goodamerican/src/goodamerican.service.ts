/**
 * Good American — Inclusive fashion brand selling denim, ready-to-wear, swim, and accessories.
 *
 * Good American is a fashion brand founded in 2016 offering denim,
 * ready-to-wear, swim, and accessories with a focus on inclusive sizing. It
 * is a certified B Corp and sells direct-to-consumer online and through
 * retail stores.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / Fashion e-commerce. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `goodamerican`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/goodamerican`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
