/**
 * Dexterra Group — Provider of facilities management, workforce accommodations, and industrial support services.
 *
 * Dexterra Group Inc. is a publicly listed Canadian company (TSX:DXT)
 * providing integrated facilities management, workforce accommodations, and
 * support services across industrial, commercial, and remote-site markets in
 * North America.
 *
 * Sector: Facilities management / Industrial services. HQ: Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Dexterra`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Dexterra`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
