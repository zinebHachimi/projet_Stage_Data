/**
 * Aircall — Cloud-based phone and customer communications platform for businesses.
 *
 * Aircall provides a cloud telephony and customer communications platform
 * that integrates with CRM and helpdesk tools for sales and support teams.
 * It operates offices across Europe, the US, and Australia.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Cloud Communications. HQ: Paris, Ile-de-France, France.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `aircall`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/aircall`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
