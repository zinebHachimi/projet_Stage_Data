/**
 * Cyber & Mason (PinDirect) — Amersfoort payments company delivering card/terminal payment solutions for SMBs and hospitality under the PinDirect brand.
 *
 * Cyber & Mason, operating under the PinDirect brand, is a Dutch payments
 * company based in Amersfoort that provides payment terminals and
 * transaction-processing solutions aimed at SMBs and the hospitality sector.
 * Its Recruitee board (cybermason.recruitee.com) listed four live openings
 * across IT, sales and customer support.
 *
 * Sector: Payments / SME acquiring. HQ: Amersfoort, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `cybermason`
 * (`https://cybermason.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
