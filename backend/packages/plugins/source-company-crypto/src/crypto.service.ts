/**
 * Crypto.com — Cryptocurrency exchange and financial-services platform for retail and institutional users.
 *
 * Crypto.com operates a cryptocurrency exchange and financial-services
 * platform offering trading, payments, and related digital-asset products to
 * retail and institutional customers globally. It was founded in 2016.
 *
 * Sector: Crypto / Fintech. HQ: Singapore, Singapore.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `crypto`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/crypto`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
