/**
 * Compa — Compensation data and management software for talent teams.
 *
 * Compa is a compensation-management software company that provides data and
 * tools to help talent and total-rewards teams benchmark and manage pay. It
 * focuses on compensation workflows for recruiting and HR. The company is
 * venture-backed.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / HR technology. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `compa`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/compa`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
