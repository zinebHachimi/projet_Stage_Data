/**
 * Zoox — Autonomous robotaxi company building purpose-built driverless vehicles.
 *
 * Zoox develops a purpose-built autonomous robotaxi and the full-stack
 * self-driving system that operates it. It is a subsidiary of Amazon and
 * runs test and deployment operations in multiple US cities.
 *
 * Sector: Autonomous Vehicles. HQ: Foster City, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `zoox`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/zoox`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
