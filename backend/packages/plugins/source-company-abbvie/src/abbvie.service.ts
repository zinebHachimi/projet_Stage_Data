/**
 * AbbVie — Global research-based biopharmaceutical company developing medicines in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and eye care.
 *
 * AbbVie is a global biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and
 * commercializes medicines across therapeutic areas including immunology,
 * oncology, neuroscience, and aesthetics. It was formed in 2013 as a
 * spin-off from Abbott Laboratories. The company is headquartered in North
 * Chicago, Illinois.
 *
 * Sector: Pharmaceuticals. HQ: North Chicago, Illinois, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AbbVie`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AbbVie`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
