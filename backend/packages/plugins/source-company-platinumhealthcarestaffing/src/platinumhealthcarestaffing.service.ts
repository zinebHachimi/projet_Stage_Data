/**
 * Platinum Healthcare Staffing — Staffing agency placing nurses and healthcare professionals across the United States.
 *
 * Platinum Healthcare Staffing is a US staffing agency that recruits and
 * places registered nurses and other healthcare professionals in travel and
 * contract assignments with hospitals and facilities. It supports a range of
 * clinical specialties.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare Staffing. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `PlatinumHealthcareStaffingInc`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/PlatinumHealthcareStaffingInc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
