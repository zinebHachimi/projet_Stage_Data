/**
 * Shaw\'s — New England supermarket chain and part of the Albertsons family of grocery stores.
 *
 * Shaw's is a supermarket chain operating across New England and part of the
 * Albertsons Companies group. It runs full-service grocery stores offering
 * food, pharmacy, and household goods. The chain has roots dating to the
 * 19th century and employs thousands of associates.
 *
 * Sector: Grocery retail (supermarkets). HQ: West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Shaws`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Shaws`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
