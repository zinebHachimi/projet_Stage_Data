/**
 * Astra Security — Penetration testing and vulnerability management platform.
 *
 * Astra Security provides a pentest platform that combines automated
 * scanning with manual penetration testing to help companies find and fix
 * vulnerabilities in their applications. The platform supports managing
 * pentests and remediation workflows.
 *
 * Sector: Offensive Security / Pentesting. HQ: Delaware, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `astra`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/astra`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
