/**
 * North 40 Outfitters — Regional farm, ranch, and outdoor lifestyle retailer in the US Pacific Northwest and Mountain West.
 *
 * North 40 Outfitters is a US retail chain serving farm, ranch, work, and
 * outdoor lifestyle customers across the Pacific Northwest and Mountain
 * West. Stores carry clothing, footwear, tools, agricultural supplies, and
 * outdoor gear. It operates both brick-and-mortar stores and an online shop.
 *
 * Sector: Retail (farm, ranch & outdoor goods). HQ: Havre, Montana, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `North40Outfitters`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/North40Outfitters`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
