/**
 * Atria Group — IT staffing, consulting and software development firm.
 *
 * Atria Group provides staffing, consulting, software development and
 * training services in the information technology domain. It places
 * technology professionals with clients across the United States.
 *
 * Sector: IT staffing and consulting. HQ: Bloomington, Minnesota, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AtriaGroupLLC`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AtriaGroupLLC`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
