/**
 * Rula — Behavioral health platform connecting patients with in-network therapists and psychiatric providers.
 *
 * Rula is a behavioral health company that matches patients with licensed
 * therapists and psychiatric providers and supports insurance-based care. It
 * provides clinicians with tools to manage scheduling, documentation, and
 * billing. The company operates across many US states.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (mental health). HQ: Los Angeles, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `rula`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/rula`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
