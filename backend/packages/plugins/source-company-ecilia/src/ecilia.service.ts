/**
 * Ecilia — SaaS software vendor for the insurance sector, developer of the Modulr platform.
 *
 * Ecilia is a French SaaS company that has developed 'Modulr', a platform
 * for insurance-sector clients, in operation since 2001. It is a
 * small-to-medium enterprise (around twenty employees) describing itself as
 * entering a new growth phase. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at
 * ecilia.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: InsurTech / SaaS. HQ: France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `ecilia`
 * (`https://ecilia.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
