/**
 * Unit — An embedded finance platform providing banking and capital as a service.
 *
 * Unit is an embedded finance platform offering ready-to-launch financial
 * services such as banking accounts and capital, enabling companies to build
 * financial products for their end users. It has raised over $160M from
 * investors including Insight Partners and Accel.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Embedded finance / BaaS. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `unit`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/unit`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
