/**
 * Proof — Identity-assured transaction management platform for verifying identity and preventing fraud in high-value transactions.
 *
 * Proof provides an identity-assured transaction management platform that
 * verifies identities and secures online transactions such as real estate
 * closings, mortgage approvals, and auto sales, with the goal of
 * establishing digital trust and preventing fraud.
 *
 * Sector: Cybersecurity / Fraud Prevention (Identity Verification). HQ: Austin, Texas, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `proof`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/proof`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
