/**
 * City of Philadelphia — Municipal government of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
 *
 * The City of Philadelphia is the municipal government of Philadelphia,
 * Pennsylvania. It employs staff across city departments including project
 * management, public services, and administration, and posts its job
 * openings on its SmartRecruiters careers page.
 *
 * Sector: Government / public sector (municipal government). HQ: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CityofPhiladelphia`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CityofPhiladelphia`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
