/**
 * CROSSMARK — Sales and retail merchandising services provider for consumer goods brands and retailers.
 *
 * CROSSMARK is a US sales and marketing services company serving consumer
 * goods manufacturers and retailers. It provides in-store merchandising,
 * product demonstrations, and retail execution across grocery and
 * mass-market stores. The company staffs merchandising and
 * brand-representation roles nationwide.
 *
 * Sector: Retail sales & merchandising services (consumer goods). HQ: Plano, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CROSSMARK1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CROSSMARK1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
