/**
 * Uncommon Schools — Non-profit network of public charter schools across New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
 *
 * Uncommon Schools is a non-profit network of public charter schools
 * operating campuses across New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. It runs
 * K-12 schools focused on college preparation and hires teachers, coaches,
 * and school-support staff.
 *
 * Sector: Education (K-12 public charter schools / non-profit). HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `UncommonSchools`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/UncommonSchools`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
