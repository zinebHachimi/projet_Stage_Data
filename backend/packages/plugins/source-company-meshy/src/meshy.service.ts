/**
 * Meshy — AI platform for generating 3D models from text and images.
 *
 * Meshy develops an AI platform that generates 3D models and textures from
 * text prompts and images, aimed at game developers, artists, and creators.
 * The company operates an AI model-serving infrastructure supporting its
 * generation products.
 *
 * Sector: AI infrastructure / 3D generation. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `meshy`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/meshy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
