/**
 * Cyderes — Global managed cybersecurity services provider delivering managed detection and response, identity, and security engineering.
 *
 * Cyderes is a managed cybersecurity services provider offering managed
 * detection and response, identity and access management, and security
 * engineering across platforms such as Microsoft Sentinel and SailPoint. It
 * operates globally for enterprise clients.
 *
 * Sector: Cybersecurity (Managed Security Services). HQ: Kansas City, Missouri, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `cyderes`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/cyderes`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
