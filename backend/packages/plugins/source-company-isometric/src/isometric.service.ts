/**
 * Isometric — Operates a scientific carbon removal registry that verifies and issues carbon credits.
 *
 * Isometric is a carbon removal registry that develops scientific protocols
 * to measure, verify, and issue credits for durable carbon removal projects.
 * It focuses on transparency and rigorous measurement in the carbon removal
 * market. The company is based in London.
 *
 * Sector: Carbon removal / registry. HQ: London, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `isometric`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/isometric`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
