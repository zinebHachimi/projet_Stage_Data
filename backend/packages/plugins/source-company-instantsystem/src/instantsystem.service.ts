/**
 * Instant System — Mobility-as-a-Service SaaS provider building white-label multimodal urban-mobility apps for transit authorities.
 *
 * Instant System is a French company based in Sophia-Antipolis (Biot) that
 * develops web and mobile applications for urban mobility, offering
 * white-label Mobility-as-a-Service platforms to public transit authorities
 * that combine buses, trains, bikes, scooters and ride-sharing. Careers are
 * hosted on Recruitee at instantsystem.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: MobilityTech / SaaS. HQ: Sophia-Antipolis, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `instantsystem`
 * (`https://instantsystem.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
