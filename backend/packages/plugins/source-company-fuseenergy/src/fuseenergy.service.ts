/**
 * Fuse Energy — Develops pulsed-power fusion technology and related high-energy systems.
 *
 * Fuse is a company working on fusion energy using pulsed-power technology
 * and high-energy laser and electrical systems. It employs engineers and
 * computational physicists across sites including San Leandro, California
 * and Montreal. The company's work is aimed at advancing the path toward
 * fusion energy.
 *
 * Sector: Fusion energy. HQ: San Leandro, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `fuse`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/fuse`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
