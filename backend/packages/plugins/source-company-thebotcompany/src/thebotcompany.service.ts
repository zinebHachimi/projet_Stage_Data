/**
 * The Bot Company — Develops household robots for consumers.
 *
 * The Bot Company is developing robotics technology aimed at building a
 * helpful robot for the home. The company operates a small on-site
 * engineering team drawn from technology and automotive backgrounds. It is
 * based in San Francisco, California.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Consumer hardware. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `thebotcompany`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/thebotcompany`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
