/**
 * Raising Cane\'s — Fast-food restaurant chain specializing in chicken finger meals.
 *
 * Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers is an American quick-service restaurant
 * chain founded in 1996 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Its menu is centered on
 * chicken finger meals with crinkle-cut fries, Texas toast, coleslaw, and
 * its signature sauce. The company operates hundreds of locations across the
 * United States and internationally.
 *
 * Sector: Restaurants (Quick-Service). HQ: Plano, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `RaisingCanes`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/RaisingCanes`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
