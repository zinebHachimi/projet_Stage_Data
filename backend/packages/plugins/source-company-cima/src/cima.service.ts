/**
 * CIMA+ — Canadian multidisciplinary engineering firm covering infrastructure, buildings, energy, and transportation.
 *
 * CIMA+ is an employee-owned Canadian consulting engineering firm. It
 * provides services in infrastructure, transportation, buildings, energy,
 * telecommunications, and project management. The company is headquartered
 * in Laval, Quebec.
 *
 * Sector: Engineering & Construction Consultancy. HQ: Laval, Quebec, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CIMA2`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CIMA2`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
