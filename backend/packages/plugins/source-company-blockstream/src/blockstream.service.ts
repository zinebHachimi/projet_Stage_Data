/**
 * Blockstream — Builds Bitcoin infrastructure including the Liquid Network and Lightning tooling.
 *
 * Blockstream builds infrastructure and products on the Bitcoin protocol.
 * Its work spans layer-2 projects such as the Liquid Network and Core
 * Lightning, along with end-user software and hardware wallets. The company
 * focuses on foundational Bitcoin technology.
 *
 * Sector: Bitcoin infrastructure. HQ: Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `blockstream`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/blockstream`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
