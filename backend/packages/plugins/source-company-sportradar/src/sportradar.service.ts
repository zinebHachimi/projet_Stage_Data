/**
 * Sportradar — Sports technology company at the intersection of sports, media and betting.
 *
 * Sportradar is a sports technology company that collects and distributes
 * sports data and provides technology to sports federations, media outlets
 * and betting operators. It hires software engineers, data operators, sales
 * and product roles across many countries.
 *
 * Sector: Sports Media & Betting Technology. HQ: St. Gallen, Switzerland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Sportradar`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Sportradar`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
