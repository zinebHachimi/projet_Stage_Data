/**
 * vTech Solution — IT staffing and managed services provider serving government and commercial clients.
 *
 * vTech Solution is an IT staffing and managed services company that places
 * technology professionals and delivers infrastructure and support services.
 * It serves government agencies and commercial organizations across the
 * United States.
 *
 * Sector: IT staffing and services. HQ: Washington, D.C., United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `VTechSolution1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/VTechSolution1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
