/**
 * Blue Energy — Develops nuclear power projects using shipyard-style manufacturing to deploy new capacity faster.
 *
 * Blue Energy is a company working to deploy new nuclear generation capacity
 * at scale, aiming to speed up the path to building nuclear megawatts. Its
 * approach centers on manufacturing and siting methods intended to reduce
 * the cost and time of nuclear deployment. The company positions its work
 * around energy security and decarbonization.
 *
 * Sector: Nuclear energy. HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `blue-energy`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/blue-energy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
