/**
 * epilot — Cloud SaaS platform for digitalizing sales and processes in the energy sector.
 *
 * epilot GmbH operates a cloud platform that digitalizes the energy
 * industry, enabling utilities, energy providers, and grid operators to sell
 * and manage complex products online and coordinate with partners. The
 * company is headquartered in Cologne.
 *
 * Sector: Energy software / SaaS. HQ: Cologne, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `epilot`
 * (`https://epilot.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
