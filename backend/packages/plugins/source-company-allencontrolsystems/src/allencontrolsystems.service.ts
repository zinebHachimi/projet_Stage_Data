/**
 * Allen Control Systems — Defense robotics company building AI-powered autonomous
 * counter-drone weapon systems.
 *
 * Allen Control Systems (ACS) is an Austin, Texas-based defense
 * robotics company that develops autonomous counter-drone weapon
 * systems for U.S. and allied forces. Its flagship Bullfrog product
 * line uses AI, computer vision, and robotic fire control to detect,
 * track, and engage small unmanned aircraft. The company was founded
 * by Mike Wior, Steve Simoni, and Luke Allen, and manufactures its
 * systems in Austin. Hiring spans Engineering, Manufacturing, Supply
 * Chain, Quality, and Business Operations, including roles such as
 * Advanced Drone Operator and Buyer.
 *
 * Sector: Defense Technology / Robotics. HQ: Austin, TX, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `allen-control-systems`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/allen-control-systems`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
 *
 * (Previously read the Greenhouse board `allencontrolsystems`, which is stale —
 * the live, canonical board is Ashby. See find-company-plugin reconciliation.)
