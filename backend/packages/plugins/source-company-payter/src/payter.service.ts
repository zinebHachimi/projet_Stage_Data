/**
 * Payter — Rotterdam company building contactless NFC and cashless payment terminals for unattended points of sale.
 *
 * Payter B.V. is a Rotterdam-based payments company operating since 2007
 * that develops contactless NFC and cashless payment devices for unattended
 * environments such as EV charging, retail and vending. It runs its careers
 * site on Recruitee (payter.recruitee.com), where it listed multiple
 * engineering, product and commercial roles based in the Netherlands.
 *
 * Sector: Payments hardware / unattended payments. HQ: Rotterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `payter`
 * (`https://payter.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
