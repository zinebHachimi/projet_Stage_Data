/**
 * Achieve — Digital personal finance company offering lending and debt resolution products.
 *
 * Achieve is a digital personal finance company that provides personal
 * loans, home equity lending, and debt resolution and settlement services to
 * consumers. It focuses on helping people manage and reduce debt.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech / consumer finance & lending. HQ: Tempe, Arizona, USA (San Mateo, CA).
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Achieve1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Achieve1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
