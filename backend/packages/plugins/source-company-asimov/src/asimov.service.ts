/**
 * Asimov — Synthetic biology company designing genetic systems for therapeutics manufacturing.
 *
 * Asimov is a synthetic biology company that develops technologies for
 * designing genetic systems, with a focus on improving biologics and
 * cell/gene therapy manufacturing. It combines computational design tools
 * with wet-lab biology. The company is based in Boston.
 *
 * Sector: Biotech (synthetic biology). HQ: Boston, MA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `asimov`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/asimov`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
