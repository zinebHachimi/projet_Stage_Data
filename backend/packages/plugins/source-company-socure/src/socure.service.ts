/**
 * Socure — Digital identity verification and fraud-prevention platform powered by predictive analytics and machine learning.
 *
 * Socure builds identity verification and fraud-prevention technology using
 * predictive analytics and machine learning trained on large volumes of
 * signals. Its RiskOS platform supports identity verification, KYC, and
 * fraud detection for financial services and other sectors.
 *
 * Sector: Identity Verification & Fraud. HQ: Incline Village, Nevada, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `socure`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/socure`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
