/**
 * Hinge Health — Digital clinic for musculoskeletal (joint and muscle) care.
 *
 * Hinge Health offers a digital care platform for musculoskeletal
 * conditions, combining exercise therapy, wearable sensors, and clinical
 * support. It is offered as a benefit through employers and health plans.
 * The company is publicly traded.
 *
 * Sector: Digital health (musculoskeletal). HQ: San Francisco, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `hinge-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/hinge-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
