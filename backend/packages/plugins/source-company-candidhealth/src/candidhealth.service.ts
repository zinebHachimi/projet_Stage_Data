/**
 * Candid Health — Medical billing and revenue cycle automation platform for healthcare providers.
 *
 * Candid Health provides software that automates medical billing and revenue
 * cycle management for healthcare organizations. Its platform handles claims
 * submission, denials, and payment reconciliation. It serves digital health
 * and provider groups.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (revenue cycle / billing). HQ: San Francisco, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `candidhealth`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/candidhealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
