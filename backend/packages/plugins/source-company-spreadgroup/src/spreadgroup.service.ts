/**
 * Spread Group — Leipzig-based print-on-demand e-commerce group (Spreadshirt, Spreadshop) selling made-to-order customized apparel and lifestyle products.
 *
 * Spread Group is a Leipzig-headquartered print-on-demand e-commerce
 * company, known for its Spreadshirt and Spreadshop brands, providing
 * made-to-order customized apparel and lifestyle products and a platform for
 * creators to sell their own designs. Its Recruitee board
 * (spreadgroup.recruitee.com) returned a JSON offers array with roles such
 * as 'Strategic Partnerships Manager', 'Payment & Treasury Operations
 * Manager' and 'Puncher / Embroidery Specialist'.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce / print-on-demand marketplace. HQ: Leipzig, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `spreadgroup`
 * (`https://spreadgroup.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
