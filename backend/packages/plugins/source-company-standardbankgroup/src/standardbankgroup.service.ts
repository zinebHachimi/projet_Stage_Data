/**
 * Standard Bank Group — Africa\'s largest bank by assets, offering retail, business, and corporate banking.
 *
 * Standard Bank Group is a financial services group headquartered in South
 * Africa, operating across many African countries and select global markets.
 * It provides personal and business banking, corporate and investment
 * banking, and wealth and insurance services. It is Africa's largest bank by
 * assets.
 *
 * Sector: Banking / financial services. HQ: Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `StandardBankGroup`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/StandardBankGroup`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
