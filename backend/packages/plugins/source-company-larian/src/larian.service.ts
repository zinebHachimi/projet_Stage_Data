/**
 * Larian Studios — Independent video game developer known for the Divinity and Baldur\'s Gate role-playing game series.
 *
 * Larian Studios is a video game developer that produces role-playing games
 * including the Divinity series and Baldur's Gate 3. It operates studios
 * across several countries.
 *
 * Sector: gaming. HQ: Ghent, East Flanders, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `larian`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/larian`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
