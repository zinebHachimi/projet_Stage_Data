/**
 * Auberge Resorts Collection — Luxury hotel and resort group with extensive restaurant and food-and-beverage operations.
 *
 * Auberge Resorts Collection is a portfolio of luxury hotels, resorts,
 * residences, and private clubs. Each property operates its own restaurants,
 * bars, and food-and-beverage programs, and the group hires extensively for
 * culinary and F&B roles. It is headquartered in Mill Valley, California.
 *
 * Sector: Restaurants & Hospitality (Food & Beverage). HQ: Mill Valley, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AubergeCollection`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AubergeCollection`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
