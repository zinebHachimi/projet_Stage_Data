/**
 * Tempo — Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for stablecoins and real-world payments.
 *
 * Tempo is a layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for stablecoins and real-world
 * payments. It draws on payments and crypto engineering expertise from its
 * founding backers. The project focuses on blockchain infrastructure for
 * payment use cases.
 *
 * Sector: Layer-1 blockchain / payments. HQ: Remote.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `tempo-xyz`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/tempo-xyz`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
