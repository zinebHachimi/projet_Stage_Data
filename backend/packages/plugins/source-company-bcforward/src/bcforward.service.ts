/**
 * BCforward — IT and business solutions staffing firm founded in 1998.
 *
 * BCforward is an IT and business process staffing firm that provides
 * personnel and workforce solutions to commercial and government clients.
 * Founded in 1998, it offers staff augmentation, project services and
 * managed staffing.
 *
 * Sector: IT staffing and workforce solutions. HQ: Indianapolis, Indiana, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `BCforward3`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/BCforward3`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
