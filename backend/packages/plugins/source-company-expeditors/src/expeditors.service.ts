/**
 * Expeditors — Global logistics and freight forwarding company providing supply chain services.
 *
 * Expeditors International is a global logistics company headquartered in
 * Seattle, offering air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage,
 * warehousing, and supply chain solutions. It operates a worldwide network
 * of offices across six continents.
 *
 * Sector: Logistics. HQ: Seattle, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Expeditors`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Expeditors`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
