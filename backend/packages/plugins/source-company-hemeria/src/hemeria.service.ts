/**
 * HEMERIA — Aerospace and defense company building nanosatellites, stratospheric balloons and radar systems.
 *
 * HEMERIA is a French aerospace and defense company that designs, produces
 * and supplies advanced space systems and vehicles, including
 * nanosatellites, stratospheric balloons and radar systems, for commercial,
 * institutional and scientific customers. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at
 * hemeriagroup.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: Aerospace / Defense / Deep tech. HQ: France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `hemeriagroup`
 * (`https://hemeriagroup.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
