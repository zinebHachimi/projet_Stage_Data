/**
 * Proforto — E-commerce retailer of workwear, personal protective equipment and safety footwear for professionals.
 *
 * Proforto is a Dutch e-commerce company selling workwear, personal
 * protective equipment (PPE) and safety shoes to professionals across
 * Europe, operating multiple webshops (including ESVSHOP). The Recruitee
 * board proforto.recruitee.com returned 10 live offers spanning recruitment,
 * customer service, logistics (Oosterhout warehouse), sales and supply-chain
 * internships, primarily in Nijmegen.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce retail (workwear / PPE). HQ: Nijmegen, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `proforto`
 * (`https://proforto.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
