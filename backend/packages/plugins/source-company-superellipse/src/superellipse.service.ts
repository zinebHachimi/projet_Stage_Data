/**
 * Superellipse — Digital design and engineering studio (innovation agency).
 *
 * Superellipse is an Antwerp-based digital design and engineering studio.
 * Its Recruitee board at superellipse.recruitee.com listed 3 offers,
 * including a digital designer role and internship/open-application listings
 * in Antwerp and Mechelen.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Design & engineering studio. HQ: Antwerp, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `superellipse`
 * (`https://superellipse.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
