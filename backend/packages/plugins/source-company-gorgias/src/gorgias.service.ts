/**
 * Gorgias — Customer support and helpdesk platform built for e-commerce merchants.
 *
 * Gorgias provides a customer support and helpdesk platform designed for
 * e-commerce stores, with deep integrations into platforms such as Shopify.
 * It centralizes customer conversations across channels and adds automation
 * to help merchants respond faster. The company is headquartered in San
 * Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce tech / customer support. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `gorgias`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/gorgias`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
