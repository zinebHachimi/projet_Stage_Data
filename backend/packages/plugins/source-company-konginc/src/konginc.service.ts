/**
 * Kong Inc. — Developer of cloud API management and connectivity technologies.
 *
 * Kong Inc. builds cloud API technologies, including an API gateway and
 * service connectivity platform, on a mission to help organizations become
 * API-first. Its products serve companies from startups to large
 * enterprises. Kong is headquartered in San Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: API infrastructure / Platform engineering. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `kong`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/kong`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
