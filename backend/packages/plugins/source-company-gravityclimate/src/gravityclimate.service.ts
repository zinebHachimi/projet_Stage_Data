/**
 * Gravity Climate — Provides software for industrial companies to measure and manage carbon emissions and energy use.
 *
 * Gravity Climate builds software that helps industrial businesses and their
 * partners measure, track, and manage greenhouse gas emissions and energy
 * data. The platform is aimed at carbon accounting and decarbonization
 * planning for industrial operations. The company is based in San Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: Carbon / energy management software. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `gravityclimate`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/gravityclimate`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
