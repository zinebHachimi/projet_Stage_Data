/**
 * Common Room — AI-native customer intelligence and go-to-market platform.
 *
 * Common Room is a customer-intelligence platform that unifies first-party
 * customer data with buyer signals from sources such as social media,
 * communities, and product usage into a person-level view for go-to-market
 * teams. It includes AI agents for research, enrichment, and outbound. The
 * company was founded in 2020 and is headquartered in Seattle.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / go-to-market software. HQ: Seattle, Washington, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `commonroom`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/commonroom`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
