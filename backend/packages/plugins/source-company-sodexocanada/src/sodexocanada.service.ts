/**
 * Sodexo Canada — Canadian arm of the global food services and facilities management company.
 *
 * Sodexo Canada is the Canadian operating entity of Sodexo, a global
 * provider of food services and integrated facilities management. It
 * delivers catering, corporate dining, and food service operations across
 * corporate, healthcare, education, and other sites in Canada.
 *
 * Sector: Food Services & Facilities Management. HQ: Burlington, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SodexoCanadaLtd`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SodexoCanadaLtd`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
