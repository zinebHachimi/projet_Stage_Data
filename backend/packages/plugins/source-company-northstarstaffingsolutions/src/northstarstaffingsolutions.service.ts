/**
 * North Star Staffing Solutions — Staffing agency placing candidates across multiple industries.
 *
 * North Star Staffing Solutions is a staffing agency that connects job
 * seekers with employers across a range of fields. It provides recruiting
 * and placement services for direct-hire and contract roles.
 *
 * Sector: Staffing and recruiting. HQ: Denver, Colorado, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `NorthStarStaffingSolutions1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/NorthStarStaffingSolutions1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
