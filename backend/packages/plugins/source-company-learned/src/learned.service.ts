/**
 * Learned — HR software platform for performance management, reviews, and employee development.
 *
 * Learned is a Utrecht-based HR SaaS company whose platform supports
 * performance management, reviews, goal-setting, and employee development.
 * Its stack spans React front ends and Node.js back-end services.
 *
 * Sector: HR-tech SaaS. HQ: Utrecht, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `learned`
 * (`https://learned.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
