/**
 * CSC Generation — Holding company that acquires and operates retail and e-commerce brands.
 *
 * CSC Generation is a holding company that acquires established retail and
 * direct-to-consumer brands and operates them, including Sur La Table and
 * Backcountry. It runs distribution centers and retail operations across the
 * US.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / E-commerce. HQ: Merrillville, Indiana, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `cscgeneration-2`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/cscgeneration-2`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
