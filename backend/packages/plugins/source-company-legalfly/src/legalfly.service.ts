/**
 * LegalFly — Legal AI platform for automating legal workflows and document review.
 *
 * LegalFly is a legal-AI company with offices in Ghent and London, building
 * a platform for the legal industry. Its Recruitee board at
 * legalfly.recruitee.com listed 5 offers, including product engineering in
 * Ghent and sales roles in London.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Legal AI. HQ: Ghent, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `legalfly`
 * (`https://legalfly.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
