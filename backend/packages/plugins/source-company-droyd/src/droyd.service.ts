/**
 * Droyd — Designs and manufactures autonomous robots that automate repetitive manual work.
 *
 * Droyd designs autonomous robotic systems that automate repetitive manual
 * work for enterprises, building the hardware, control stack, and data to
 * enable generalist robotics. The company manufactures hardware in-house and
 * operates as an in-person company in San Francisco, California.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Industrial automation. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `droyd`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/droyd`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
