/**
 * William Osler Health System — Community hospital system serving the western Greater Toronto Area in Ontario.
 *
 * William Osler Health System is a Canadian community hospital corporation
 * operating hospitals and a health services centre serving Brampton,
 * Etobicoke, and the surrounding western Greater Toronto Area. It provides
 * acute care, emergency, and specialty services.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Brampton, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `williamoslerhealthsystem1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/williamoslerhealthsystem1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
