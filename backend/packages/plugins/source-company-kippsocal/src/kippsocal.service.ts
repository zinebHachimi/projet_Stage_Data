/**
 * KIPP SoCal Public Schools — Network of tuition-free public charter schools in Southern California.
 *
 * KIPP SoCal Public Schools operates a network of tuition-free,
 * open-enrollment public charter schools across Southern California, hiring
 * teachers and program staff.
 *
 * Sector: education. HQ: Los Angeles, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `kippsocal`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/kippsocal`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
