/**
 * Laurel — AI time platform that automatically captures and categorizes professionals\' time.
 *
 * Laurel builds an AI-native time platform that automatically captures,
 * categorizes, and analyzes how professionals spend their time on work and
 * admin tasks, mapping time to business outcomes. It serves
 * professional-services firms such as legal, accounting, and consulting
 * practices. The company is headquartered in San Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / professional services automation. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `laurel`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/laurel`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
