/**
 * SonderMind — Behavioral health platform connecting patients with therapists and psychiatric providers.
 *
 * SonderMind is a behavioral health company that matches individuals with
 * licensed therapists and psychiatric providers. It supports in-network,
 * insurance-based care and provides tools for clinicians to manage their
 * practices. The company operates across multiple US states.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (mental health). HQ: Denver, CO, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sondermind`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sondermind`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
