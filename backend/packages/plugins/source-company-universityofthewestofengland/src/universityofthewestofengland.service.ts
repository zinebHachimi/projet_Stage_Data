/**
 * University of the West of England — Public research university based in Bristol, England.
 *
 * The University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) is a public research
 * university located in Bristol, United Kingdom. It offers undergraduate and
 * postgraduate programs across faculties including business, health,
 * engineering, arts, and social sciences, and hires academic and
 * professional-services staff.
 *
 * Sector: Education (higher education). HQ: Bristol, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `UniversityOfTheWestOfEngland`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/UniversityOfTheWestOfEngland`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
