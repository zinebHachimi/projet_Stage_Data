/**
 * Helloprint — Online marketplace/platform for customizable printed products connecting buyers with local print production.
 *
 * Helloprint is a Rotterdam-based e-commerce platform for customizable
 * printed products, connecting customers with a network of print producers;
 * it is B Corp-certified and also operates a Valencia office. Its careers
 * copy states an AI-first operating model and ~EUR 100M revenue. The
 * Recruitee board helloprint.recruitee.com returned 3 live offers (growth,
 * an AI engineer role, and an open application), all office-first in
 * Rotterdam or Valencia.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce marketplace (custom print). HQ: Rotterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `helloprint`
 * (`https://helloprint.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
