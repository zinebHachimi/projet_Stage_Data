/**
 * Outreach — Sales execution and engagement platform for revenue teams.
 *
 * Outreach builds a sales execution platform that helps revenue teams manage
 * prospecting, deal workflows, and forecasting. It sells to enterprise and
 * mid-market sales organizations.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Sales Engagement. HQ: Seattle, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `outreach`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/outreach`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
