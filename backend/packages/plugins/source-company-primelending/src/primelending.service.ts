/**
 * PrimeLending — US residential mortgage lender originating purchase and refinance home loans.
 *
 * PrimeLending is a US residential mortgage lender offering purchase and
 * refinance home loan products, including conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA
 * loans. It is a subsidiary of Hilltop Holdings.
 *
 * Sector: Financial services / mortgage lending. HQ: Dallas, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `PrimeLending`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/PrimeLending`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
