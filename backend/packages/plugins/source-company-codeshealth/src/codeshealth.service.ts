/**
 * Codes Health — Builds technology products for healthcare delivery and operations.
 *
 * Codes Health is a healthcare technology company building software products
 * for healthcare delivery and operations. It hires across engineering and
 * product functions. The company posts roles including software engineering.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech. HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `codes-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/codes-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
