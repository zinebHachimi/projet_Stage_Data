/**
 * Ask IT Consulting — IT consulting, business consulting and outsourcing services firm.
 *
 * Ask IT Consulting provides technology, business consulting and outsourcing
 * services along with IT staffing. It places technology professionals with
 * enterprise and public-sector clients across the United States.
 *
 * Sector: IT consulting and staffing. HQ: Edison, New Jersey, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AskITConsulting`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AskITConsulting`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
