/**
 * Rowan — Ear-piercing and jewelry retailer with studios staffed by licensed nurses.
 *
 * Rowan is a retailer offering ear piercing performed by licensed nurses
 * along with a line of jewelry sold online and through its studios. It
 * operates retail studio locations across multiple US states.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / Consumer. HQ: Larchmont, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `heyrowan`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/heyrowan`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
