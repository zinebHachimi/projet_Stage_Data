/**
 * Hopper — Mobile-first travel booking marketplace for flights, hotels, and travel fintech products.
 *
 * Hopper is a travel booking app and marketplace that lets users book
 * flights, hotels, and rental cars, and sells travel fintech products such
 * as price freeze and cancellation protection. It also powers travel
 * commerce for third parties through its HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions)
 * API. The company is headquartered in Montreal.
 *
 * Sector: Travel marketplace / e-commerce. HQ: Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `hopper`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/hopper`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
