/**
 * Look Up Space — Space-tech company operating a global radar network for space surveillance and debris management.
 *
 * SAS Look Up Space is a French space-technology company specializing in
 * space surveillance and space-debris management, developing and operating a
 * network of sovereign radars for space traffic management. Careers are
 * hosted on Recruitee at lookup.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: SpaceTech / Deep tech. HQ: France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `lookup`
 * (`https://lookup.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
