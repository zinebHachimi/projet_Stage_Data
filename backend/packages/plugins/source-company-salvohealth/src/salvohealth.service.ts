/**
 * Salvo Health — Virtual specialty care company focused on chronic digestive and gastrointestinal conditions.
 *
 * Salvo Health offers virtual, team-based care for chronic gastrointestinal
 * conditions, combining clinicians, dietitians, and health coaches with a
 * digital care model in partnership with GI providers.
 *
 * Sector: Digital Health. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `salvohealth`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/salvohealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
