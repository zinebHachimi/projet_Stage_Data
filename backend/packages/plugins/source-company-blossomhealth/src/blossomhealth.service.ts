/**
 * Blossom Health — Partners with psychiatrists to expand access to affordable mental health care.
 *
 * Blossom Health is a mental health company that partners with psychiatrists
 * to expand access to affordable, timely psychiatric care. It provides
 * technology and operational support for clinical delivery. The company
 * hires across clinical and operational roles.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (mental health). HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `blossom-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/blossom-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
