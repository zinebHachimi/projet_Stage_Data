/**
 * Shop Manufaktur — Bremen-based e-commerce company operating online shops, with hiring focused on Shopify and online-marketing roles.
 *
 * Shop Manufaktur GmbH is a Bremen-based e-commerce company. Its Recruitee
 * board (shopmanufaktur.recruitee.com) returned a JSON offers array with
 * roles including 'Shopify E-Commerce Manager (m/w/d)', 'Experte für
 * Onlinemarketing (m/w/d)' and office-management positions, all based in
 * Bremen.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce (online shop operator). HQ: Bremen, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `shopmanufaktur`
 * (`https://shopmanufaktur.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
