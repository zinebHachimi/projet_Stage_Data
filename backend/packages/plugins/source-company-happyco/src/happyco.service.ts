/**
 * HappyCo — Real-time property data platform for the multifamily real-estate sector.
 *
 * HappyCo builds mobile and cloud software that captures real-time property
 * data and unifies operational data into an entity model and property graph
 * for multifamily property management analytics.
 *
 * Sector: Property data platform. HQ: Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `happyco`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/happyco`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
