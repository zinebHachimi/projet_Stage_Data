/**
 * Peripass — Yard-management SaaS that digitizes and automates logistics yard operations.
 *
 * Peripass is a Ghent-based SaaS scale-up providing yard-management software
 * that digitalizes and automates complex logistics environments. Its
 * Recruitee board at peripass.recruitee.com listed 6 offers including
 * product management and sales roles based in Gent and Amsterdam.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Logistics SaaS. HQ: Ghent, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `peripass`
 * (`https://peripass.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
