/**
 * ClickUp — All-in-one productivity platform for tasks, docs, goals, and project management.
 *
 * ClickUp is a productivity and project-management platform that combines
 * tasks, documents, goals, dashboards, and chat in one application. It is
 * aimed at helping teams consolidate work across multiple tools. The company
 * is headquartered in San Diego.
 *
 * Sector: Productivity & collaboration software. HQ: San Diego, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `clickup`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/clickup`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
