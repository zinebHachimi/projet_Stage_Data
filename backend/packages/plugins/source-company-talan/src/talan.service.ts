/**
 * Talan — French consulting group focused on technology, data and business transformation.
 *
 * Talan is a France-headquartered international consulting group
 * specialising in technology, data, AI and business transformation. It
 * delivers advisory and implementation services to enterprise clients across
 * Europe, the UK and other regions.
 *
 * Sector: Technology & management consulting. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Talan`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Talan`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
