/**
 * Finary — A personal finance and wealth management app for tracking investments and net worth.
 *
 * Finary is a personal finance application that lets users track
 * investments, budgets, and net worth in real time, linking banks, brokers,
 * crypto platforms, and real estate. It provides performance reports,
 * dividend tracking, and fee analysis.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Personal finance & wealth tracking. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `finary`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/finary`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
