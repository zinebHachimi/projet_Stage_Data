/**
 * Sika — Specialty chemicals company supplying materials for construction and industrial bonding, sealing, and reinforcing.
 *
 * Sika is a specialty chemicals company that develops and produces systems
 * and products for bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing, and protecting in
 * the building sector and motor vehicle industry. Its products include
 * concrete admixtures, mortars, sealants, adhesives, and roofing and
 * flooring systems. It is headquartered in Baar, Switzerland.
 *
 * Sector: Construction Materials & Specialty Chemicals. HQ: Baar, Switzerland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SikaAG`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SikaAG`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
