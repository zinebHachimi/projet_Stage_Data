/**
 * Delta Electronics — Manufacturer of power supplies, industrial automation, and thermal management products.
 *
 * Delta Electronics is a provider of power and thermal management solutions.
 * Its portfolio includes switching power supplies, industrial automation,
 * building automation, and infrastructure products for a range of
 * industries.
 *
 * Sector: Industrial electronics / Power & automation. HQ: Taipei, Taiwan.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `DeltaElectronics`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/DeltaElectronics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
