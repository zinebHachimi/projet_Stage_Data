/**
 * Cohere — Builds large language models and AI infrastructure for enterprises.
 *
 * Cohere develops large language models and related tooling aimed at
 * enterprise use cases such as search, retrieval, and generation. It
 * provides its models through an API and offers deployment options for
 * businesses.
 *
 * Sector: AI foundation-model lab. HQ: Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `cohere`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/cohere`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
