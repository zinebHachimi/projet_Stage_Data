/**
 * SPAN — Makes a smart electrical panel that helps homes manage energy, solar, batteries, and EV charging.
 *
 * SPAN designs and builds a smart home electrical panel and related products
 * that give homeowners visibility and control over their electricity use.
 * Its products integrate with solar, battery storage, and EV charging to
 * support home electrification. The company focuses on reducing carbon
 * emissions from the built environment.
 *
 * Sector: Home electrification / grid. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `span`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/span`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
