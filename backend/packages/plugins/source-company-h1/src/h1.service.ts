/**
 * H1 — Healthcare data platform connecting information on physicians, researchers, and clinical trials.
 *
 * H1 operates a healthcare data platform that aggregates information about
 * healthcare professionals, clinical research, and trials to support
 * life-sciences commercial, medical, and clinical-operations teams.
 *
 * Sector: Health Tech / Data. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `h1`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/h1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
