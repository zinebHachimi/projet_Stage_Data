/**
 * Highbeam — A banking and finance platform for ecommerce and consumer brands.
 *
 * Highbeam is a finance platform for ecommerce and consumer brands, offering
 * embedded bank accounts and charge cards along with cash-flow management
 * and credit tools. It was founded in 2021 and is based in New York.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Business banking. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `highbeam`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/highbeam`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
