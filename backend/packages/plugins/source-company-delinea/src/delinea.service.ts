/**
 * Delinea — Privileged access management (PAM) and identity security provider.
 *
 * Delinea provides privileged access management and identity security
 * solutions that control and secure access to critical systems and
 * privileged accounts across enterprise environments. Its roles span
 * security operations and enterprise security engineering.
 *
 * Sector: Privileged Access Management. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `delinea`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/delinea`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
