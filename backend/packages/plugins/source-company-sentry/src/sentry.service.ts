/**
 * Sentry — Developer-first error tracking and application performance monitoring platform.
 *
 * Sentry develops an application monitoring and observability platform that
 * helps developers detect, trace, and fix errors and performance issues. Its
 * core error-tracking software is open source and used by developers and
 * organizations worldwide.
 *
 * Sector: Observability / Developer tools. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sentry`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sentry`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
