/**
 * Allium — Blockchain data platform building a system of record for onchain finance.
 *
 * Allium is a blockchain data platform that structures onchain data for
 * analytics and financial use cases. It positions itself as a system of
 * record for onchain finance. The company has team members across New York,
 * San Francisco, Singapore, and remote.
 *
 * Sector: Onchain data infrastructure. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `allium`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/allium`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
