/**
 * PS Logistics — US flatbed trucking and third-party logistics provider.
 *
 * PS Logistics is a US-based flatbed transportation and third-party
 * logistics provider headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. It offers
 * dedicated trucking, warehousing, and brokerage services across the United
 * States through a family of logistics brands.
 *
 * Sector: Logistics & Trucking. HQ: Birmingham, Alabama, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `PSLogistics`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/PSLogistics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
