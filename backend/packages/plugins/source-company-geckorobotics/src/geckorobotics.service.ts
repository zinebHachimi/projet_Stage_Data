/**
 * Gecko Robotics — Builds wall-climbing inspection robots and software for critical infrastructure.
 *
 * Gecko Robotics builds wall-climbing robots and AI software to inspect and
 * assess the health of critical physical infrastructure such as power
 * plants, ships, and industrial facilities. Its Cantilever operating
 * platform aggregates inspection data. The company is headquartered in
 * Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Industrial inspection. HQ: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `gecko-robotics`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/gecko-robotics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
