/**
 * Delivery Hero — Local delivery technology platform operating across many countries.
 *
 * Delivery Hero operates online food ordering and quick-commerce delivery
 * platforms across numerous countries. It builds large-scale consumer apps,
 * logistics software, and backend engineering systems. The company is
 * publicly traded.
 *
 * Sector: Technology platform (online food and quick commerce). HQ: Berlin, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `DeliveryHero`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/DeliveryHero`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
