/**
 * Assystem — Engineering group focused on infrastructure and energy, including nuclear projects.
 *
 * Assystem is an international engineering company providing design, project
 * management, and technical consulting services. It focuses heavily on the
 * energy sector, including nuclear, as well as transport and other
 * infrastructure. The company is headquartered in France.
 *
 * Sector: Engineering Consultancy. HQ: Courbevoie, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ASSYSTEM`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ASSYSTEM`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
