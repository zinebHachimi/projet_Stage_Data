/**
 * Red Canyon Engineering & Software — Aerospace engineering and flight software services for space missions.
 *
 * Red Canyon provides engineering and flight software services for
 * spacecraft and space missions, supporting navigation, flight software, and
 * systems engineering for aerospace programs.
 *
 * Sector: Space/Aerospace. HQ: Denver, Colorado, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `redcanyonsoftware`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/redcanyonsoftware`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
