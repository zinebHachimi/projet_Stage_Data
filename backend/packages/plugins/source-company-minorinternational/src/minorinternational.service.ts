/**
 * Minor International — Global hospitality group operating hotels, resorts, and restaurants across multiple countries.
 *
 * Minor International (Minor Hotels) is a Thailand-based hospitality and
 * restaurant group headquartered in Bangkok. It operates and manages hotels,
 * resorts, and residences across numerous countries under brands such as
 * Anantara, Avani, and NH Hotels, alongside restaurant and lifestyle
 * businesses.
 *
 * Sector: Hospitality. HQ: Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `MinorInternational`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/MinorInternational`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
