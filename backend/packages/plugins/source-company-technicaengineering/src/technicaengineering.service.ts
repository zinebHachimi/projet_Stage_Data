/**
 * Technica Engineering — Automotive software and electronics for vehicle data communication.
 *
 * Technica Engineering GmbH develops and produces its own software and
 * electronic products in the field of vehicle development, specializing in
 * automotive Ethernet and ECU development. It is headquartered in Munich.
 *
 * Sector: Automotive software / electronics. HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `technicaengineeringgmbh`
 * (`https://technicaengineeringgmbh.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
