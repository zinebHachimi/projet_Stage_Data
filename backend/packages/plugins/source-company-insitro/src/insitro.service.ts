/**
 * insitro — Machine-learning-driven drug discovery and development company.
 *
 * insitro is a biotechnology company that applies machine learning and
 * high-throughput biology to drug discovery and development. It builds
 * predictive models from large-scale biological and clinical data. The
 * company develops its own therapeutic programs and partners with
 * pharmaceutical companies.
 *
 * Sector: Biotech (machine learning drug discovery). HQ: South San Francisco, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `insitro`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/insitro`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
