/**
 * Artech — IT staffing and workforce solutions firm serving enterprise clients.
 *
 * Artech is an information technology staffing and workforce solutions
 * company offering staff augmentation, direct hire, payrolling and
 * recruitment process outsourcing. It provides technology talent to
 * enterprise and government clients.
 *
 * Sector: IT staffing and workforce solutions. HQ: Morristown, New Jersey, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ArtechInformationSystemLLC`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ArtechInformationSystemLLC`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
