/**
 * ON2IT — Cybersecurity company providing Zero Trust security services and a managed security platform.
 *
 * ON2IT is a Zaltbommel-based cybersecurity company delivering Zero Trust
 * security services, managed detection and response (SOC), and a security
 * orchestration platform. It hires security consultants, SOC specialists,
 * and PHP/Go developers.
 *
 * Sector: Cybersecurity SaaS / services. HQ: Zaltbommel, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `on2it`
 * (`https://on2it.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
