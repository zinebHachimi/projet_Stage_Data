/**
 * Circadia Health — Medical device and data company for contactless remote patient monitoring.
 *
 * Circadia Health develops a contactless remote patient monitoring system
 * combining hardware, software, and algorithms to continuously track vital
 * signs and detect medical events, with an FDA-cleared monitoring product.
 *
 * Sector: Health Tech / Medical Device. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `circadiahealth`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/circadiahealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
