/**
 * gridscale — Cloud infrastructure platform provider (part of OVHcloud).
 *
 * gridscale GmbH provides cloud infrastructure services and builds an
 * OpenStack-based on-premise cloud platform. Based in Cologne, it is part of
 * OVHcloud and emphasizes sustainable cloud infrastructure.
 *
 * Sector: Cloud infrastructure / IaaS. HQ: Cologne, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `gridscale`
 * (`https://gridscale.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
