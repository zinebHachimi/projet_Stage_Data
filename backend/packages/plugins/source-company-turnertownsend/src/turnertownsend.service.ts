/**
 * Turner & Townsend — Global professional services firm specializing in program management and cost consultancy for construction and real estate.
 *
 * Turner & Townsend is a professional services company providing program
 * management, project management, cost management, and advisory services. It
 * works with clients across real estate, infrastructure, and natural
 * resources sectors. The firm operates in more than 60 countries.
 *
 * Sector: Real Estate & Construction Consultancy. HQ: Leeds, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `TurnerTownsend`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/TurnerTownsend`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
