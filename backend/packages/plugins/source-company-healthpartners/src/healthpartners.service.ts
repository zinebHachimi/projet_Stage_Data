/**
 * HealthPartners — Integrated non-profit health care provider and health insurance organization in Minnesota.
 *
 * HealthPartners is a Minnesota-based, non-profit organization that combines
 * a care delivery system of hospitals and clinics with a health insurance
 * plan. It provides medical care, dental care, and coverage to members and
 * patients across the upper Midwest.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Integrated Health System. HQ: Bloomington, Minnesota, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `HealthPartners1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/HealthPartners1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
