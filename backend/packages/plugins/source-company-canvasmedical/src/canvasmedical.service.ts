/**
 * Canvas Medical — Builds an EHR platform with AI agents that automate clinical and administrative work.
 *
 * Canvas Medical provides an electronic health record platform and develops
 * AI agents that automate work for its customers. Applied AI roles lead
 * evaluations for in-development and deployed agents.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / healthcare software. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `canvasmedical`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/canvasmedical`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
