/**
 * Overview Energy — Develops satellites that beam solar energy to terrestrial solar farms so they can generate power around the clock.
 *
 * Overview Energy is developing space-based solar power technology that
 * collects sunlight in orbit and transmits it as near-infrared laser light
 * to existing solar installations on Earth. The goal is to let solar farms
 * generate power at night and become a 24/7 energy resource. The company has
 * demonstrated airborne power-beaming and targets orbital demonstrations
 * later this decade.
 *
 * Sector: Space-based solar power. HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `overviewenergy`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/overviewenergy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
