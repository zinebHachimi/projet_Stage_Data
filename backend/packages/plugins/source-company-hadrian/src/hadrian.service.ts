/**
 * Hadrian — Operates autonomous, software-driven factories for aerospace and defense components.
 *
 * Hadrian builds autonomous factories that combine software, robotics, and
 * precision machining to manufacture components for aerospace and defense
 * customers. The company operates facilities including a factory in Mesa,
 * Arizona. It is headquartered in the Los Angeles area.
 *
 * Sector: Manufacturing automation / Aerospace & defense. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `hadrian-automation`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/hadrian-automation`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
