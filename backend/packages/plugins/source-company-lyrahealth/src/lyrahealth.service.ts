/**
 * Lyra Health — Mental health benefits platform for employers connecting members to therapy and coaching.
 *
 * Lyra Health provides workforce mental health benefits, matching employees
 * and dependents to therapy, coaching, and self-guided care through a
 * provider network and digital platform sold to employers.
 *
 * Sector: Digital Health / Mental Health. HQ: Burlingame, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `lyrahealth`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/lyrahealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
