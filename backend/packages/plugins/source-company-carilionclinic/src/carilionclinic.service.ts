/**
 * Carilion Clinic — Not-for-profit integrated health system serving southwest Virginia.
 *
 * Carilion Clinic is a not-for-profit integrated health care organization
 * serving communities in southwest Virginia through hospitals, physician
 * practices, and outpatient services. It is affiliated with the Virginia
 * Tech Carilion School of Medicine.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Roanoke, Virginia, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CarilionClinic`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CarilionClinic`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
