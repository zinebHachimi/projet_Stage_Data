/**
 * The Athletic — Subscription-based digital sports journalism publication.
 *
 * The Athletic is a digital sports media company producing
 * subscription-based journalism covering professional and college sports. It
 * is owned by The New York Times.
 *
 * Sector: media. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `theathletic`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/theathletic`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
