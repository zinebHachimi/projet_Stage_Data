/**
 * Longbridge Financial — US lender specializing in reverse mortgages and home equity products for seniors.
 *
 * Longbridge Financial is a US mortgage lender specializing in reverse
 * mortgages and home equity products aimed at older homeowners. It
 * originates and services these loans across multiple states.
 *
 * Sector: Financial services / mortgage lending. HQ: Mahwah, New Jersey, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `LongbridgeFinancial`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/LongbridgeFinancial`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
