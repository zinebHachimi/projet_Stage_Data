/**
 * Omni — Business intelligence and embedded analytics platform.
 *
 * Omni is a business intelligence and embedded analytics platform that
 * supports self-service analysis and customer-facing data products. Based in
 * San Francisco, it has raised $217M from investors, including a $120M
 * Series C. The company hires across Sales, Engineering, Solutions
 * Architecture, Customer Support, and Marketing in the US, EMEA, and APAC.
 *
 * Sector: Analytics / Business Intelligence. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `omni`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/omni`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
