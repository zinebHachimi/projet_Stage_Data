/**
 * Cornerstone Building Brands — Manufacturer of exterior building products including windows, siding, and metal building systems.
 *
 * Cornerstone Building Brands is a manufacturer of exterior building
 * products for residential and commercial construction, including vinyl
 * windows, vinyl siding, stone veneer, metal roofing, and metal wall and
 * building systems.
 *
 * Sector: Building products manufacturing. HQ: Cary, North Carolina, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `cornerstonebuildingbrandscareers`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/cornerstonebuildingbrandscareers`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
