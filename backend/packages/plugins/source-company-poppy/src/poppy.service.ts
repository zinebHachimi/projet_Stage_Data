/**
 * Poppy — Belgian shared-mobility (car-sharing) operator with in-house tech team.
 *
 * Poppy is a Belgian shared-mobility (car-sharing) company operating in
 * Brussels and Antwerp, with an in-house engineering team. Its Recruitee
 * board at poppy.recruitee.com listed 5 offers across HR, operations, and
 * automotive-technical roles in Antwerp and Vilvoorde.
 *
 * Sector: Technology / Shared mobility. HQ: Antwerp, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `poppy`
 * (`https://poppy.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
