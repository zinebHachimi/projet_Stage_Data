/**
 * Genomics plc — Uses large-scale genetic and health data to advance drug discovery and preventative healthcare.
 *
 * Genomics plc is a TechBio company that combines large-scale genetic and
 * health data with proprietary analytics to support drug discovery and
 * predictive, preventative healthcare. It develops polygenic risk scores to
 * help assess individual disease risk. The company has offices in Oxford and
 * London.
 *
 * Sector: Biotech / TechBio (genomics). HQ: Oxford, England, UK.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `genomics`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/genomics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
