/**
 * WSH Group — UK contract catering and hospitality group operating brands including BaxterStorey.
 *
 * WSH Group is a UK-based hospitality and contract catering group
 * headquartered in London. It operates foodservice and hospitality brands
 * such as BaxterStorey, Searcys, and Benugo, serving corporate offices,
 * venues, and events across the UK and Europe.
 *
 * Sector: Hospitality & Catering. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `WSHGroup`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/WSHGroup`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
