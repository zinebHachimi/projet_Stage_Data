/**
 * LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics — Perfumes and cosmetics division of luxury group LVMH, spanning multiple beauty brands.
 *
 * LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics is the beauty division of the LVMH group,
 * encompassing perfume, makeup, and skincare houses. It develops and sells
 * consumer beauty products globally through retail, wholesale, and
 * e-commerce. The division includes several established fragrance and
 * cosmetics maisons.
 *
 * Sector: Beauty & cosmetics (consumer goods). HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `lvmhperfumescosmetics`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/lvmhperfumescosmetics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
