/**
 * Columbia University — Private Ivy League research university in New York City.
 *
 * Columbia University is a private Ivy League research university located in
 * New York City. It offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional
 * programs across a wide range of disciplines and conducts research across
 * the sciences, humanities, and professional fields. This SmartRecruiters
 * presence hosts adjunct, lecturer, and administrative openings.
 *
 * Sector: Education (higher education). HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ColumbiaUniversity1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ColumbiaUniversity1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
