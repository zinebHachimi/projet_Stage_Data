/**
 * Wise — Technology company building cross-border money movement infrastructure.
 *
 * Wise is a financial technology company that builds software and
 * infrastructure for international money transfers and multi-currency
 * accounts. It operates its own payments platform and engineering
 * organization. The company is publicly traded.
 *
 * Sector: Financial technology (fintech). HQ: London, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Wise`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Wise`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
