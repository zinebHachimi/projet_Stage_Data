/**
 * ICTS (UK) Ltd — UK provider of security and aviation-related services.
 *
 * ICTS (UK) Ltd is a United Kingdom-based provider of security services,
 * including aviation security, screening and guarding for commercial and
 * public-sector clients. It is part of the international ICTS group.
 *
 * Sector: Security & aviation services. HQ: United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ICTSUKLtd`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ICTSUKLtd`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
