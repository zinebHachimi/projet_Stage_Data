/**
 * Office Depot — Office products and business supplies retailer operating stores and e-commerce under Office Depot and OfficeMax.
 *
 * Office Depot is a US retailer of office products, technology, furniture,
 * and business services, part of The ODP Corporation. It operates retail
 * stores under the Office Depot and OfficeMax banners plus an e-commerce
 * channel. The company also provides business-to-business supply and
 * services.
 *
 * Sector: Retail (office products & business supplies). HQ: Boca Raton, Florida, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `OfficeDepot`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/OfficeDepot`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
