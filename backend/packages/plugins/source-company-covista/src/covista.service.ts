/**
 * Covista — Healthcare-focused higher education provider, formerly Adtalem Global Education, and parent of Chamberlain University and Walden University.
 *
 * Covista (formerly Adtalem Global Education) is a large U.S. workforce
 * solutions and higher-education provider focused on healthcare education.
 * It is the parent organization of institutions including Chamberlain
 * University, Walden University, Ross University School of Medicine, and
 * Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine. It educates nursing,
 * medical, and other healthcare professionals across campuses nationwide and
 * online.
 *
 * Sector: Education (higher education / healthcare education). HQ: Chicago, Illinois, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Covista`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Covista`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
