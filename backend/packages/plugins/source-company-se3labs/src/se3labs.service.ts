/**
 * SE3 Labs — Builds GPS-denied spatial-AI navigation software for autonomous drone swarms.
 *
 * SE3 Labs is a Munich-based spatial AI company providing GPS-denied
 * autonomous navigation and shared 3D situational awareness for aerial and
 * ground drone swarms. Its on-edge software combines visual-inertial
 * odometry, real-time 3D perception, and natural-language command. The
 * company was founded in 2023 by researchers from the Technical University
 * of Munich and has German Bundeswehr contracts.
 *
 * Sector: Defense (Spatial AI / Drones). HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `se3`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/se3`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
