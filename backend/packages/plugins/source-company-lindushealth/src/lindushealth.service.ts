/**
 * Lindus Health — Contract research organization running end-to-end clinical trials.
 *
 * Lindus Health is a clinical research organization (CRO) that runs clinical
 * trials end-to-end using its own technology platform. It aims to make
 * trials faster and more reliable for biotech and pharma sponsors. The
 * company operates in the UK and US.
 *
 * Sector: Biotech / healthtech (clinical trials). HQ: London, England, UK.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `lindus`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/lindus`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
