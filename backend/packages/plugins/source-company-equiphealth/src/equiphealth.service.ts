/**
 * Equip Health — Virtual, evidence-based treatment for eating disorders.
 *
 * Equip Health provides virtual treatment for eating disorders using a
 * team-based model that includes therapists, dietitians, physicians, and
 * peer and family mentors. Care is delivered remotely across the United
 * States. Treatment is based on evidence-based protocols such as
 * family-based treatment.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (eating disorder care). HQ: Carlsbad, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `equip`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/equip`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
