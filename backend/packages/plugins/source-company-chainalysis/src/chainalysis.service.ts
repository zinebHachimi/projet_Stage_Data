/**
 * Chainalysis — Blockchain data platform for compliance, investigation, and risk analysis.
 *
 * Chainalysis provides blockchain data and analytics used by government
 * agencies and businesses to investigate and manage risk in cryptocurrency.
 * Its products support compliance, investigations, and transaction
 * monitoring. It has offices in multiple locations including New York and
 * Tel Aviv.
 *
 * Sector: Blockchain analytics / compliance. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `chainalysis-careers`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/chainalysis-careers`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
