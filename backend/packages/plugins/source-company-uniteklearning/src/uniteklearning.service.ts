/**
 * Unitek Learning — Network of nursing and healthcare-focused vocational schools across several U.S. states.
 *
 * Unitek Learning is a healthcare education provider operating a network of
 * schools and colleges across multiple U.S. states. It offers nursing and
 * allied-health programs, including practical nursing, registered nursing,
 * and medical assisting, through campus-based and blended learning formats.
 *
 * Sector: Education (healthcare / vocational education). HQ: Draper, Utah, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `UnitekLearning`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/UnitekLearning`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
