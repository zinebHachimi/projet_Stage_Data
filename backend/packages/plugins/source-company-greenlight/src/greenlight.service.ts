/**
 * Greenlight Financial Technology — Family finance app providing debit cards and money-management tools for kids and teens.
 *
 * Greenlight offers a family finance platform combining debit cards, banking
 * features, and money-management and financial-literacy tools designed for
 * kids, teens, and their parents.
 *
 * Sector: Consumer Fintech. HQ: Atlanta, Georgia, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `greenlight`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/greenlight`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
