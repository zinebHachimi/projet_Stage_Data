/**
 * Charge Robotics — Builds robotic systems that automate the construction of utility-scale solar farms.
 *
 * Charge Robotics is a Series A startup building robots that automate the
 * mechanical installation of utility-scale solar farms. The company develops
 * hardware to speed up field assembly of solar arrays. It is headquartered
 * in San Leandro, California, with field operations in Phoenix, Arizona.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Renewable energy automation. HQ: San Leandro, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `charge-robotics`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/charge-robotics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
