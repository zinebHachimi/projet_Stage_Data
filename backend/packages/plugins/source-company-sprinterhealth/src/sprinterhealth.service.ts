/**
 * Sprinter Health — Delivers in-home health services including lab work and preventive care.
 *
 * Sprinter Health provides in-home healthcare services such as blood draws,
 * diagnostics, and preventive care visits. It dispatches trained field
 * clinicians and coordinates with health plans and providers. The company
 * operates across multiple US markets.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (in-home care). HQ: Menlo Park, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sprinter-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sprinter-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
