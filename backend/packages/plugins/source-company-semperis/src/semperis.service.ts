/**
 * Semperis — Identity security and resilience platform focused on Active Directory and Entra ID.
 *
 * Semperis provides identity security and resilience solutions focused on
 * protecting, monitoring, and recovering directory services such as Active
 * Directory and Entra ID. Its products target detection, response, and
 * recovery from identity-based attacks.
 *
 * Sector: Identity Security. HQ: Hoboken, New Jersey, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `semperis`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/semperis`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
