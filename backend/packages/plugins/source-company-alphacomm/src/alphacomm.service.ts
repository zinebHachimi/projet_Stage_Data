/**
 * Alphacomm — Digital goods and payments infrastructure provider for telcos, airlines, OTAs, and retailers.
 *
 * Alphacomm is a Rotterdam-based digital goods and SaaS company providing
 * payments and digital-goods infrastructure (brands including Checkmaxx and
 * Collectmaxx) for telcos, airlines, OTAs, and retailers across Europe.
 *
 * Sector: Payments / digital-goods SaaS. HQ: Rotterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `alphacomm`
 * (`https://alphacomm.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
