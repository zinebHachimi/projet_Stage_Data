/**
 * TENEX.AI — AI-augmented managed detection and response (MDR) cybersecurity provider.
 *
 * TENEX.AI provides managed detection and response services that combine AI
 * automation with human analysts for threat detection and response. Its
 * roles focus on threat detection engineering and security operations.
 *
 * Sector: Managed Detection & Response. HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `tenex`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/tenex`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
