/**
 * Analytic Partners — Marketing analytics and measurement firm providing commercial and marketing-mix analytics.
 *
 * Analytic Partners provides marketing and commercial analytics, including
 * marketing-mix modeling and measurement, delivered through its analytics
 * platform and consulting teams.
 *
 * Sector: Marketing analytics. HQ: Miami, Florida, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `analyticpartners`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/analyticpartners`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
