/**
 * UpSlide — Productivity and document-automation software for Microsoft Office used by financial-services firms.
 *
 * UpSlide is a French SaaS company providing a productivity add-in for
 * Microsoft Office (PowerPoint, Word, Excel) aimed at financial-services and
 * professional-services firms. It has offices in Paris, London, New York,
 * Singapore and Berlin, with its headquarters in Paris. Careers are hosted
 * on Recruitee at upslide.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Productivity software. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `upslide`
 * (`https://upslide.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
