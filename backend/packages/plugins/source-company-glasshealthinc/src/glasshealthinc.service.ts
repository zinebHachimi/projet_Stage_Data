/**
 * Glass Health — Clinical decision support platform applying AI for physicians.
 *
 * Glass Health builds an AI-powered clinical decision support platform that
 * helps physicians generate differential diagnoses and clinical plans,
 * founded by a physician-led team.
 *
 * Sector: Health Tech / Clinical AI. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `glass-health-inc`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/glass-health-inc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
