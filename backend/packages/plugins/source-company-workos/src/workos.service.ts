/**
 * WorkOS — Developer API platform for enterprise-ready application features.
 *
 * WorkOS provides APIs that help SaaS applications add enterprise features
 * such as single sign-on, directory synchronization, user management, and
 * audit logs. It is aimed at making applications enterprise-ready with
 * minimal integration effort.
 *
 * Sector: Developer infrastructure / Identity. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `workos`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/workos`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
