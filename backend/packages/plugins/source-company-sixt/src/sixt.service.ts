/**
 * SIXT — International vehicle rental and mobility services company.
 *
 * SIXT is a German multinational mobility company headquartered in Pullach,
 * near Munich. It provides car and van rental, car sharing, and integrated
 * mobility services across Europe, North America, and other markets.
 *
 * Sector: Transportation & Mobility. HQ: Pullach, Bavaria, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Sixt`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Sixt`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
