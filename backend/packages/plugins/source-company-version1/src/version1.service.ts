/**
 * Version 1 — Technology services firm delivering enterprise applications and cloud solutions.
 *
 * Version 1 is an IT services and consulting company delivering enterprise
 * applications, cloud, data, and digital solutions. It is an Oracle,
 * Microsoft, and AWS partner delivering ERP, HCM, and cloud implementations.
 * It operates across the UK, Ireland, and other regions.
 *
 * Sector: IT services and enterprise software consulting. HQ: Dublin, Ireland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Version1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Version1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
