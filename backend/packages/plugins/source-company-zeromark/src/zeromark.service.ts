/**
 * ZeroMark — Builds a rifle-mounted, software-defined counter-drone aiming system.
 *
 * ZeroMark develops counter-unmanned-aircraft-system technology, including
 * Apex, a rifle-mounted system that adjusts a soldier's aim in real time to
 * improve hit probability against drones. The system combines computer
 * vision and precision robotics with conventional firearms. The company was
 * founded in 2022 and has raised seed funding.
 *
 * Sector: Defense (Counter-UAS). HQ: New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `zeromark`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/zeromark`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
