/**
 * Grand Games — Mobile gaming studio developing casual puzzle games.
 *
 * Grand Games is an Istanbul-based mobile game studio that develops casual
 * puzzle games. It hires across art, game development and marketing.
 *
 * Sector: gaming. HQ: Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `grand`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/grand`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
