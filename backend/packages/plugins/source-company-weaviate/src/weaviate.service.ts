/**
 * Weaviate — AI-native open-source vector database for unstructured data.
 *
 * Weaviate develops an open-source, AI-native vector database used to store
 * and search embeddings of unstructured data for machine learning and
 * retrieval applications. It offers a managed cloud service. The company
 * hires across Growth, Product, and Applied Research.
 *
 * Sector: Databases / Vector Database. HQ: Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `weaviate`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/weaviate`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
