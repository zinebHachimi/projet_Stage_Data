/**
 * Revefi — Agentic-AI platform for data reliability, quality, operations, and cloud-cost optimization.
 *
 * Revefi provides an agentic-AI platform that helps enterprises manage data
 * reliability, quality, operations, and cloud spend. It was founded in 2021
 * by co-founders of ThoughtSpot and is Series A funded.
 *
 * Sector: Data observability / AI platform. HQ: United States (with an office in Bangalore, India).
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `revefi`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/revefi`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
