/**
 * Constants for the CATS (catsone.com) hosted recruiting ATS.
 *
 * CATS powers public career portals for staffing agencies, recruiters, and
 * direct employers. Every customer tenant is served from its own sub-domain
 * under the shared apex `catsone.com`
 * (e.g. `https://authoritypartnersinc.catsone.com`). Some tenants may also
 * front their portal with a custom domain.
 *
 * ## Public surface
 *
 * CATS career portals serve fully server-rendered HTML; there is **no
 * anonymous public JSON feed**. The authenticated API
 * (`GET https://api.catsone.com/v3/portals/{id}/jobs` with an
 * `Authorization: Token <key>` header) requires a per-tenant secret key
 * and is deliberately NOT used in this adapter.
 *
 * The portal HTML layout is well-structured with stable CSS class names
 * documented in the CATS Job Widget developer guide:
 *
 *   - Tenant main careers page: `https://{slug}.catsone.com/careers/`
 *     Lists all portals configured for the tenant. Each portal entry is an
 *     anchor whose `href` matches the pattern `/careers/{portalID}-{name}`.
 *   - Portal listing page: `https://{slug}.catsone.com/careers/{portalID}-{name}`
 *     Contains a table or list of open positions; each row is wrapped in a
 *     `.cats-job` element with `.cats-job-title`, `.cats-job-location`, and
 *     `.cats-job-category` children. The `href` on the `.cats-job-title`
 *     anchor follows `/careers/{portalID}-{name}/jobs/{jobID}-{slug}`.
 *   - Pagination uses the `?page=N` query parameter (1-based). A page with
 *     fewer results than the page size indicates the final page.
 *   - Individual job detail page:
 *     `https://{slug}.catsone.com/careers/{portalID}-{name}/jobs/{jobID}-{slug}`
 *     Contains the full HTML job description and, in some tenants, inline
 *     schema.org JSON-LD (`application/ld+json`) for the JobPosting type.
 *
 * ## URL resolution
 *
 * The adapter accepts:
 *   - `companySlug` (the `{slug}` sub-domain label, e.g. `"authoritypartnersinc"`).
 *   - `companyUrl` (any full careers URL for the tenant — the first sub-domain
 *     label of the host is extracted as the slug, e.g.
 *     `"https://authoritypartnersinc.catsone.com/careers/"` → `"authoritypartnersinc"`).
 *
 * If a `portalPath` is embedded in the provided `companyUrl` (i.e. the URL
 * already points directly to a portal listing page such as
 * `"/careers/86212-General"`), the adapter uses that path directly without
 * first crawling the tenant root.
 *
 * When only a slug / root URL is given, the adapter fetches the tenant root
 * (`/careers/`) and extracts the first available portal path from the HTML.
 *
 * ## Live verification
 *
 * Verified against `authoritypartnersinc.catsone.com` on 2026-06-03:
 *   - GET `https://authoritypartnersinc.catsone.com/careers/86212-General`
 *     → HTTP 200, 28 positions rendered in server-side HTML with
 *     `.cats-job-title` / `.cats-job-location` / `.cats-job-category` nodes.
 *   - GET `https://swan.catsone.com/careers/26625-EPCM-Portal?page=2`
 *     → HTTP 200, second page of ~50 positions confirmed.
 *   - Pagination via `?page=N` confirmed; `?page=1` is equivalent to
 *     no page parameter.
 *   - No `application/json` or `application/ld+json` is present in
 *     listing pages; job detail pages also lack structured data in the
 *     sampled tenants.
 *
 * ## Approach
 *
 * Because CATS portal listings do not embed a job description, the adapter
 * collects stubs (title, url, location, category) from listing pages and
 * then fans out per-job detail requests — bounded by `resultsWanted` — to
 * fetch descriptions. Description fetches use `Promise.allSettled` so a
 * single failed detail request never aborts the batch.
