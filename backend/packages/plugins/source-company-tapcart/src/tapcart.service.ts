/**
 * Tapcart — Mobile commerce platform that builds native shopping apps for Shopify brands.
 *
 * Tapcart is a mobile commerce platform that lets Shopify brands build and
 * manage native iOS and Android shopping apps without engineering resources.
 * Its platform powers push notifications, content, and the mobile storefront
 * experience. The company is based in Santa Monica.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce tech / mobile commerce. HQ: Santa Monica, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `tapcart`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/tapcart`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
