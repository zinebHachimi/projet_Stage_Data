/**
 * Hume City Council — Local government authority for the City of Hume in Victoria, Australia.
 *
 * Hume City Council is the local government authority serving the City of
 * Hume in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It
 * delivers community, care, infrastructure, and administrative services and
 * hires across local-government roles.
 *
 * Sector: Government / public sector (local government). HQ: Broadmeadows, Victoria, Australia.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `HumeCityCouncil`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/HumeCityCouncil`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
