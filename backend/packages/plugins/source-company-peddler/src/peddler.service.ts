/**
 * Peddler — Sustainable last-mile delivery and urban logistics operator using e-bikes across Dutch cities.
 *
 * Peddler is an Amsterdam-based sustainable last-mile logistics company
 * running e-bike delivery hubs in Dutch cities. The Recruitee board
 * peddler.recruitee.com returned 8 live offers spanning logistics/operations
 * (hub associates and managers in Utrecht, Almere), customer service,
 * HR/payroll and account management, across Amsterdam, Utrecht and Almere.
 *
 * Sector: Last-mile logistics / e-commerce fulfilment. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `peddler`
 * (`https://peddler.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
