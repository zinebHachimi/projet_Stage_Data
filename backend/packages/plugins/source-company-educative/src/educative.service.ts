/**
 * Educative — Interactive online learning platform for software developers.
 *
 * Educative is an online learning platform offering interactive, text-based
 * courses for software developers and technical professionals. It has
 * engineering and content teams including in Lahore.
 *
 * Sector: education. HQ: Seattle, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `educative`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/educative`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
