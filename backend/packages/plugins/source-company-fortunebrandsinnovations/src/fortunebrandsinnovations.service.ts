/**
 * Fortune Brands Innovations — Consumer products company for home, water, and security brands.
 *
 * Fortune Brands Innovations is a US consumer products company that
 * manufactures and markets home, water, and security products. Its portfolio
 * includes plumbing, cabinetry, outdoor living, and security brands sold
 * through retail and wholesale channels. The company is publicly traded and
 * headquartered in Illinois.
 *
 * Sector: Consumer home & security products. HQ: Deerfield, Illinois, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `FortuneBrands`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/FortuneBrands`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
