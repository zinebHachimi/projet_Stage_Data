/**
 * RIOT — Security awareness platform delivering short chat-based training, phishing simulations, and employee-facing security tools.
 *
 * RIOT is a cybersecurity awareness and human-risk platform founded in 2020.
 * It delivers short chat-based training courses, phishing simulations, and
 * additional products such as email filtering, data loss prevention, and an
 * AI-powered security hotline to help organizations reduce employee-driven
 * risk.
 *
 * Sector: Cybersecurity (Security Awareness / Human Risk). HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `tryriot`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/tryriot`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
