/**
 * Standard Subsea — Builds offshore robotics including unmanned surface vessels and subsea vehicles.
 *
 * Standard Subsea is building offshore robotics, including unmanned surface
 * vessels and subsea vehicles, along with the software to operate them
 * autonomously. The company focuses on autonomy for offshore and subsea
 * operations.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Offshore autonomy. HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `standardsubsea`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/standardsubsea`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
