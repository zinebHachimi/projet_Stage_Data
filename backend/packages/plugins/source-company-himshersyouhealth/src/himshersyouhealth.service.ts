/**
 * Hims & Hers (You Health) — Telehealth provider network serving Hims & Hers direct-to-consumer care.
 *
 * This Ashby board hosts licensed medical provider roles for the Hims & Hers
 * telehealth platform, which offers direct-to-consumer care across areas
 * including weight management, mental health, sexual health, and
 * dermatology. Providers deliver care via telehealth. Hims & Hers is a
 * publicly traded company.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (telehealth). HQ: San Francisco, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `you-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/you-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
