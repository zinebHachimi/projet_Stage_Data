/**
 * Constants for the Workstream hourly-hiring ATS platform.
 *
 * Workstream (workstream.us) is an all-in-one HR, payroll, and hiring platform
 * built for the hourly/deskless workforce — restaurants, retail, hospitality, and
 * healthcare.  Every employer is assigned a short opaque account UUID (eight hex
 * characters, e.g. `36047dd7`) and a brand slug (e.g. `jamba`). Public careers
 * pages are served from:
 *
 *   https://www.workstream.us/j/{accountId}/{brandSlug}
 *
 * Additional URL aliases in the wild:
 *   - `https://got.work/{brandSlug}`          → 301 → `jobs.workstream.us/j/{brandSlug}` → 301 → the canonical URL above
 *   - `https://www.workstream.us/j/{companyIdentifier}-careers-open-positions`
 *     (older franchise-style URLs used by some enterprise accounts)
 *
 * ## Public Wire Surface (heuristic — live HTML, no anonymous JSON API found)
 *
 * The Workstream platform serves its public careers pages as server-rendered HTML
 * at two levels:
 *
 *   1. **Positions list page** (all open roles for a tenant):
 *        GET https://www.workstream.us/j/{accountId}/{brandSlug}/positions
 *        → HTML page containing `<a href="/j/{accountId}/{brandSlug}/{locationSlug}/{jobSlug}-{jobId}">` links
 *          Each link anchor contains the job title, location address, employment type,
 *          brief description snippet, and pay rate.
 *
 *   2. **Individual job detail page**:
 *        GET https://www.workstream.us/j/{accountId}/{brandSlug}/{locationSlug}/{jobSlug}-{jobId}?locale=en
 *        → HTML page containing the full job description, requirements, company name,
 *          precise location (address, city, state, ZIP, country), apply URL.
 *
 * ### URL segment anatomy
 *
 *   `{accountId}`   — 8-character hex UUID that identifies the Workstream account,
 *                     e.g. `36047dd7`.
 *   `{brandSlug}`   — URL-safe brand/company label, e.g. `jamba`, `ymca`, `ihop`.
 *   `{locationSlug}`— City slug + numeric location id, e.g. `san-jose-5497`.
 *   `{jobSlug}`     — Hyphenated job title, e.g. `general-manager`.
 *   `{jobId}`       — 8-character hex job identifier, e.g. `68051091`.
 *                     This serves as the stable ATS id.
 *
 * The `companySlug` caller input is expected to be `{accountId}/{brandSlug}`
 * (e.g. `36047dd7/jamba`), or alternatively a full `companyUrl` whose path
 * begins with `/j/{accountId}/{brandSlug}`.
 *
 * ### Authentication
 *
 * The public careers HTML is served anonymously (no auth required). The
 * Workstream REST API (`public-api.workstream.us/positions`) requires OAuth2
 * bearer tokens — it is deliberately NOT used here; we rely entirely on the
 * public HTML careers surface.
 *
 * ### Unknown / dead tenants
 *
 * An invalid or unknown `{accountId}/{brandSlug}` path returns HTTP 404 or an
 * HTML "Record does not exist." page. Both are caught and degrade to empty
 * results without throwing.
 *
 * ### Apply URL
 *
 * Each job detail page exposes a canonical apply URL at:
 *   `.../j/{accountId}/{brandSlug}/{locationSlug}/{jobSlug}-{jobId}/apply?locale=en`
 * which is constructed from the job URL.
 *
 * ### Pagination
 *
 * The `/positions` listing page renders all open positions for the tenant in a
 * single HTML response (no server-side paging). We parse all job links at once
 * and then fan out to individual detail pages for rich data (full description,
 * structured location), bounded by `resultsWanted` and `WORKSTREAM_MAX_CONCURRENCY`.
 *
 * Investigation performed 2026-06-03.
 * Tenants confirmed live: `36047dd7/jamba` (Jamba franchise), `f030c4f0/ymca`,
 * `221e9529/ihop`, `3547b62e/wendys`.
