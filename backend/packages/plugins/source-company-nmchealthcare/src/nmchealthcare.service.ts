/**
 * NMC Healthcare — Private healthcare provider operating hospitals and clinics across the UAE and wider region.
 *
 * NMC Healthcare is a private healthcare operator running hospitals, medical
 * centres, and clinics across the United Arab Emirates and other markets. It
 * provides multi-specialty inpatient and outpatient medical services.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `NMCHealthcare`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/NMCHealthcare`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
