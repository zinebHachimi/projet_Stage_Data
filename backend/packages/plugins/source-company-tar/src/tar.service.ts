/**
 * TAR — Builds behind-the-meter renewable power systems to supply off-grid electricity to data centers.
 *
 * TAR builds modular, behind-the-meter power systems combining solar,
 * battery storage, and backup generation to power data centers without
 * waiting for grid interconnection. The company manufactures, deploys, and
 * operates these islanded microgrids, initially in West Texas. It raised
 * funding to scale its off-grid power plant approach.
 *
 * Sector: Off-grid renewable power. HQ: Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `tar`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/tar`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
