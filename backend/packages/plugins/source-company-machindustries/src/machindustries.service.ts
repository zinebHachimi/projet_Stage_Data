/**
 * Mach Industries — Designs and manufactures defense hardware and weapons systems.
 *
 * Mach Industries is a defense manufacturing company developing and
 * producing hardware and systems for military applications. The company
 * deploys products aimed at supporting US and allied defense capabilities.
 * It operates across engineering and manufacturing functions.
 *
 * Sector: Defense. HQ: Huntington Beach, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `mach`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mach`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
