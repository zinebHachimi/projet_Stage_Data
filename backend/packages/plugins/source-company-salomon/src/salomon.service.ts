/**
 * Salomon — Outdoor sports brand producing footwear, apparel, and equipment, part of Amer Sports.
 *
 * Salomon is a French outdoor sports brand founded in 1947 in the French
 * Alps, now part of Amer Sports. It designs and sells footwear, apparel, and
 * gear for running, hiking, and snow sports. The brand sells through
 * wholesale, its own retail stores, and e-commerce.
 *
 * Sector: Sporting goods & outdoor apparel/footwear. HQ: Annecy, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Salomon`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Salomon`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
