/**
 * Senior plc — Engineering group manufacturing components and systems for aerospace, defense, and energy.
 *
 * Senior plc is an international engineering solutions provider operating
 * multiple businesses across several countries. It designs and manufactures
 * high-technology components and systems for the aerospace, defense, land
 * vehicle, and power and energy markets, including its Senior Aerospace SSP
 * business.
 *
 * Sector: Aerospace & defense (engineered components). HQ: Rickmansworth, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SeniorPlc1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SeniorPlc1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
