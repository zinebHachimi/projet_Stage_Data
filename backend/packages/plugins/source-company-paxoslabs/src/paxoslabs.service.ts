/**
 * Paxos Labs — Builds DeFi infrastructure for onchain liquidity strategies and risk analysis.
 *
 * Paxos Labs builds DeFi infrastructure for onchain liquidity strategies.
 * Its work includes DeFi research and risk analysis capabilities. The team
 * focuses on onchain financial infrastructure.
 *
 * Sector: DeFi infrastructure. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `paxoslabs`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/paxoslabs`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
