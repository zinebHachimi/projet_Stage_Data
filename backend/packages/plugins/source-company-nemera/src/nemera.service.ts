/**
 * Nemera — Designer and manufacturer of drug delivery devices for the pharmaceutical industry.
 *
 * Nemera designs, develops, and manufactures drug delivery devices,
 * including inhalers, injectables, ophthalmic, nasal, and dermal delivery
 * systems for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. It operates
 * manufacturing and development sites internationally. The company is
 * headquartered in France.
 *
 * Sector: Medical Devices / Drug Delivery. HQ: La Verpillière, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Nemera`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Nemera`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
