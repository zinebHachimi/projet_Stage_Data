/**
 * Paramount — US media and entertainment company spanning film, television and streaming.
 *
 * Paramount is a media and entertainment company that produces and
 * distributes film and television content and operates streaming services
 * and broadcast networks. This SmartRecruiters careers page hosts a subset
 * of its openings across corporate and operational roles.
 *
 * Sector: Media & Entertainment. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ParamountATL`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ParamountATL`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
