/**
 * Masdar — Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy company developing solar, wind and green hydrogen projects worldwide.
 *
 * Masdar (Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company) is a clean-energy developer and
 * investor headquartered in Abu Dhabi. It develops, owns and operates
 * utility-scale solar, wind and battery storage projects and is active in
 * green hydrogen. The company operates across dozens of countries.
 *
 * Sector: Renewables & Clean Energy. HQ: Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Masdar`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Masdar`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
