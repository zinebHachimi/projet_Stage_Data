/**
 * Orb — Usage-based billing infrastructure platform for software companies.
 *
 * Orb provides billing infrastructure that ingests real-time usage data and
 * translates pricing models into accurate invoices and reporting. It
 * supports usage-based, subscription, and hybrid pricing for software
 * businesses.
 *
 * Sector: Billing infrastructure / Developer platform. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `orb`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/orb`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
