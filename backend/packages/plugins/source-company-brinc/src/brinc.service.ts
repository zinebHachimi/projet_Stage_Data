/**
 * BRINC — Builds drones and communication devices for emergency and public safety response.
 *
 * BRINC develops drones and ruggedized communication devices for public
 * safety, including a drone-as-first-responder network dispatched to 911
 * calls to provide real-time visual data. Its solutions are used by public
 * safety agencies across the United States. It is headquartered in Seattle,
 * Washington.
 *
 * Sector: Drones / Public safety. HQ: Seattle, Washington, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `brinc`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/brinc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
