/**
 * Healthtech-1 — Automates repetitive administrative processes for healthcare providers.
 *
 * Healthtech-1 builds software that automates repetitive administrative
 * workflows for healthcare providers, including GP practices in the UK. Its
 * products target tasks such as patient registration. The company is based
 * in London.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (primary care automation). HQ: London, England, UK.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `healthtech-1`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/healthtech-1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
