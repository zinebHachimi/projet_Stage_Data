/**
 * City and County of San Francisco — Consolidated city-county government of San Francisco, California.
 *
 * The City and County of San Francisco is the consolidated municipal and
 * county government of San Francisco, California. It employs staff across
 * numerous departments including public health, human rights, and city
 * services, and publishes its job openings on its SmartRecruiters careers
 * page.
 *
 * Sector: Government / public sector (municipal and county government). HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `cityandcountyofsanfrancisco1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/cityandcountyofsanfrancisco1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
