/**
 * MedHealth — Group of health, medical, and employment services businesses operating primarily in Australia.
 *
 * MedHealth is an Australian group of businesses providing health, medical,
 * and employment services, including occupational health, allied health,
 * medical assessments, and disability and injury management. It operates a
 * portfolio of specialist brands across Australia and New Zealand.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare Services. HQ: Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `medhealth3`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/medhealth3`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
