/**
 * Mistertemp\' Group — HR-tech group combining digital staffing platforms with a network of physical agencies.
 *
 * Mistertemp' Group is a French HR-tech company that blends digital
 * innovation with local agency presence for temporary work and permanent
 * placement. It has built proprietary software including MisterMatch (an
 * HRIS for staffing agencies) and Mistertemp'+ (a SaaS platform for
 * healthcare-facility staffing), and operates in France, Italy, Spain and
 * Canada. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at jobsmistertemp.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: HR Tech / Staffing SaaS. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `jobsmistertemp`
 * (`https://jobsmistertemp.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
