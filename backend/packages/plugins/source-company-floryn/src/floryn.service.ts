/**
 * Floryn — Dutch SME lending fintech providing business credit under De Nederlandsche Bank supervision with a PSD2 licence.
 *
 * Floryn B.V. is a Dutch fintech based in 's-Hertogenbosch that provides
 * business credit and financing to SMEs using data-driven underwriting. It
 * operates under supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank and holds a PSD2
 * licence. Its Recruitee careers site (floryn.recruitee.com) listed roles
 * across people, marketing, analytics and software engineering. The
 * marketing alias invoicefinance.recruitee.com 302-redirects to the
 * canonical floryn board.
 *
 * Sector: SME lending / business finance. HQ: \'s-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `floryn`
 * (`https://floryn.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
