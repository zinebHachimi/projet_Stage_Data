/**
 * The Exploration Company — Develops Nyx, a reusable in-orbit space vehicle and reentry capsule.
 *
 * The Exploration Company is a European space company developing Nyx, a
 * modular and reusable orbital vehicle and reentry capsule for cargo
 * transport. Its work includes thermal protection systems and atmospheric
 * reentry capabilities. The company operates across Germany and France.
 *
 * Sector: Space. HQ: Munich, Germany / Bordeaux, France.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `the-exploration-company`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/the-exploration-company`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
