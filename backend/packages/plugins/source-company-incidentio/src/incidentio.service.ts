/**
 * incident.io — All-in-one incident management platform for engineering teams.
 *
 * incident.io provides an incident management platform that unifies on-call
 * scheduling, real-time incident response, and status pages. It is designed
 * to help engineering teams coordinate during and after incidents.
 *
 * Sector: Developer infrastructure / Incident management. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `incident`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/incident`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
