/**
 * Kraken — Energy-tech platform providing utilities with customer management, billing, and flexibility-optimization software for the energy transition.
 *
 * Kraken, the technology arm associated with Octopus Energy, licenses an
 * operating system for energy that handles customer information, billing,
 * meter data, CRM, and renewable-generation optimization for utilities
 * worldwide.
 *
 * Sector: Energy software / Utilities. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `kraken123`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/kraken123`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
