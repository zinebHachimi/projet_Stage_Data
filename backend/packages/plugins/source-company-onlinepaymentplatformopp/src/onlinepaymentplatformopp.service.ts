/**
 * Online Payment Platform (OPP) — Delft-based payment service provider specializing in marketplace and platform payments with escrow-style flows.
 *
 * Online Payment Platform (OPP) is a Dutch payment service provider based in
 * Delft, focused on split payments, escrow-style holding and payouts for
 * online marketplaces and platforms. Its Recruitee board
 * (onlinepaymentplatform.recruitee.com) listed finance, compliance and
 * engineering roles including backend (PHP), DevOps/SRE and data
 * engineering, all based in Delft. Note: the shorter slug opp.recruitee.com
 * returns empty; the verified board is onlinepaymentplatform.
 *
 * Sector: Payments / PSP for marketplaces. HQ: Delft, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `onlinepaymentplatform`
 * (`https://onlinepaymentplatform.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
