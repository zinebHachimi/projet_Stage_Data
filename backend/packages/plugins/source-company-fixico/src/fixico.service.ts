/**
 * Fixico — Digital platform for managing vehicle damage repairs, connecting fleets and insurers with repairers.
 *
 * Fixico is an Amsterdam-based company operating a digital car-repair
 * management platform that connects fleet owners, leasing companies, and
 * insurers with a network of repair shops to steer and manage damage
 * repairs.
 *
 * Sector: Automotive / repair-management platform. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `fixico`
 * (`https://fixico.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
