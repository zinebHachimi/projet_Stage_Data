/**
 * Openclaims — SaaS platform for managing and optimizing vehicle damage repair processes for insurers and fleets.
 *
 * Openclaims is an Amsterdam-based insurtech company offering a SaaS
 * platform that helps insurers, leasing companies, and fleet owners manage
 * and optimize the vehicle damage repair process. Its stack spans Mendix,
 * React, Java, and Python.
 *
 * Sector: Insurtech SaaS. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `openclaims`
 * (`https://openclaims.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
