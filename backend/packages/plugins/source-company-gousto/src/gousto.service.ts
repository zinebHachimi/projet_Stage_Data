/**
 * Gousto — UK meal-kit company delivering recipe boxes with pre-portioned ingredients.
 *
 * Gousto is a UK-based meal-kit company that delivers recipe boxes with
 * pre-portioned ingredients to customers' homes. It operates production and
 * fulfillment facilities and hires across technology, operations, and food
 * roles. It is headquartered in London.
 *
 * Sector: Food & Beverage (Meal Kits). HQ: London, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Gousto`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Gousto`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
