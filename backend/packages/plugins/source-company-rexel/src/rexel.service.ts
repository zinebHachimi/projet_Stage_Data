/**
 * Rexel — Global distributor of electrical supplies and energy products, including solar and battery storage systems.
 *
 * Rexel is a French distributor of electrical products and energy solutions
 * to installers, industry and end-users. Its offering includes solar panels,
 * inverters, battery energy storage and related products supporting
 * electrification and renewable energy adoption.
 *
 * Sector: Electrical & Energy Distribution. HQ: Paris, Ile-de-France, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `REXEL1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/REXEL1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
