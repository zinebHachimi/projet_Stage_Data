/**
 * Datafold — Data quality and migration automation platform for data engineering teams.
 *
 * Datafold builds a data quality and migration automation platform for data
 * engineering teams, including data diffing and testing tools. The company
 * operates remotely with forward-deployed data engineering and sales roles
 * in the US and EU.
 *
 * Sector: Data Infrastructure / Data Quality. HQ: Remote (US-registered).
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `datafold`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/datafold`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
