/**
 * Cowboy Space Corp. — Develops satellites to collect solar energy in orbit and transmit it to Earth.
 *
 * Cowboy Space Corp. is building infrastructure for the orbital economy,
 * with satellites in low Earth orbit designed to collect sunlight and
 * transmit energy via infrared lasers. The company was founded in 2024 by
 * Baiju Bhatt. Its engineering spans avionics, propulsion, spacecraft, and
 * optical communications.
 *
 * Sector: Space. HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `cowboyspace`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/cowboyspace`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
