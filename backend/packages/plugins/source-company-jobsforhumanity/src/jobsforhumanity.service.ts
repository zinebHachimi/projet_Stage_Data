/**
 * Jobs for Humanity — Non-profit platform connecting underrepresented talent with inclusive employers.
 *
 * Jobs for Humanity is a non-profit organization focused on workforce
 * inclusion, connecting historically underrepresented and marginalized job
 * seekers with employers committed to inclusive hiring. It aggregates and
 * hosts a large volume of partner-employer postings on its SmartRecruiters
 * presence.
 *
 * Sector: Non-profit (workforce inclusion / employment). HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `jobsforhumanity`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/jobsforhumanity`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
