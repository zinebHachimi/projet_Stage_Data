/**
 * Payflows — AI-powered finance platform centralizing spend, treasury, and finance workflows for enterprises.
 *
 * Payflows is a Paris-based fintech building an AI-powered finance platform
 * that unifies procurement, spend, cash and treasury management for finance
 * teams. Its careers board is hosted on Recruitee at payflows.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech / Finance SaaS. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `payflows`
 * (`https://payflows.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
