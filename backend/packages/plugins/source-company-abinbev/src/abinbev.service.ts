/**
 * AB InBev — Multinational brewing company producing beer and beverage brands.
 *
 * Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) is a multinational drinks and brewing
 * company. It produces and distributes a large portfolio of beer brands
 * globally, along with other beverages, and operates breweries and
 * distribution across many countries. It is headquartered in Leuven,
 * Belgium.
 *
 * Sector: Beverages (Brewing). HQ: Leuven, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ABInBev1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ABInBev1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
