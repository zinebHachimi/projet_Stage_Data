/**
 * Bosch Home Comfort — Bosch division manufacturing heating, ventilation, and hot water systems for residential and commercial use.
 *
 * Bosch Home Comfort Group (formerly Bosch Thermotechnology) is the Bosch
 * division that develops and manufactures heating, cooling, and hot water
 * solutions, including heat pumps, boilers, and water heaters, for
 * residential and commercial buildings.
 *
 * Sector: Industrial / HVAC & heating equipment. HQ: Wetzlar, Hesse, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Bosch-HomeComfort`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Bosch-HomeComfort`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
