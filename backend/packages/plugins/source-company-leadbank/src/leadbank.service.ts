/**
 * Lead Bank — An FDIC-insured bank building infrastructure for embedded financial products.
 *
 * Lead is a bank and technology company that builds banking infrastructure
 * for embedded financial products and services, operating an FDIC-insured
 * bank. It serves fintech partners with banking and payments rails.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Banking infrastructure. HQ: Kansas City, Missouri, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `leadbank`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/leadbank`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
