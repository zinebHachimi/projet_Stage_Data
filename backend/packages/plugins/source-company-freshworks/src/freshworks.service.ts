/**
 * Freshworks — SaaS provider of customer service and IT service management software.
 *
 * Freshworks develops cloud-based business software for customer support,
 * sales, marketing, and IT service management. Its products include
 * Freshdesk and Freshservice. The company serves businesses of varying sizes
 * and is publicly traded.
 *
 * Sector: Enterprise SaaS (customer and employee software). HQ: San Mateo, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Freshworks`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Freshworks`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
