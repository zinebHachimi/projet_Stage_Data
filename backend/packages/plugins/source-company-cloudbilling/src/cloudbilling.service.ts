/**
 * CloudBilling — Naarden-based Dutch SaaS company providing flexible billing, invoicing and monetization software.
 *
 * CloudBilling B.V. is a Dutch software company based in Naarden that
 * provides configurable billing, rating and invoicing software used to
 * monetize products and services. Its Recruitee careers site
 * (cloudbilling.recruitee.com) listed four live openings, with the company
 * describing itself as a growing Dutch tech company in billing and
 * business-intelligence.
 *
 * Sector: Billing / monetization SaaS. HQ: Naarden, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `cloudbilling`
 * (`https://cloudbilling.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
