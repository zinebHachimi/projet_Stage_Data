/**
 * Aditi Staffing — IT staffing firm providing contract and direct-hire technology talent.
 *
 * Aditi Staffing is an IT staffing company offering contract,
 * contract-to-hire and direct-hire placement of technology professionals to
 * enterprise clients. It is a certified minority business enterprise.
 *
 * Sector: IT staffing. HQ: Bellevue, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AditiStaffing1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AditiStaffing1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
