/**
 * Safe Security — Cyber risk quantification and management company that models and predicts breach likelihood for enterprises.
 *
 * Safe Security builds a platform for cyber risk quantification and
 * management, giving enterprises data-driven measurement of breach
 * likelihood and financial exposure. The company is Series C funded and
 * operates across the US and India.
 *
 * Sector: Cybersecurity (Cyber Risk Quantification). HQ: Palo Alto, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `safe`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/safe`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
