/**
 * Entire Hire — Staffing and executive search firm placing professional and management talent.
 *
 * Entire Hire is a staffing and executive search firm that recruits for
 * professional, management and consulting roles across industries. It
 * provides permanent and executive search services.
 *
 * Sector: Staffing and executive search. HQ: Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `entirehire`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/entirehire`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
