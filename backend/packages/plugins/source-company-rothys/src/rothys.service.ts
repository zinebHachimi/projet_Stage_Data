/**
 * Rothy\'s — Direct-to-consumer footwear and accessories brand made from recycled materials.
 *
 * Rothy's is a direct-to-consumer brand that designs and sells shoes, bags,
 * and accessories, many made using recycled plastic and other recycled
 * materials. It sells online and through its own retail stores. The company
 * is based in San Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / DTC consumer brand. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `rothys`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/rothys`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
