/**
 * Vertuoza — Construction-management software for small and mid-size building firms.
 *
 * Vertuoza is a Walloon software company building management software for
 * construction SMEs. Its Recruitee board at vertuoza.recruitee.com listed 5
 * offers including Lead Platform Engineer and several sales roles, all based
 * in Nivelles, Belgium.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Construction SaaS. HQ: Nivelles, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `vertuoza`
 * (`https://vertuoza.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
