/**
 * Pattern — E-commerce acceleration company managing brands across online marketplaces.
 *
 * Pattern is an e-commerce acceleration company that uses technology and AI
 * to manage brands' sales and fulfillment across marketplaces including
 * Amazon, Walmart, and Target. It owns Reach Logistics, which operates
 * warehouses across multiple countries.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce / Marketplaces. HQ: Lehi, Utah, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `pattern`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/pattern`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
