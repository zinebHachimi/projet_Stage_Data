/**
 * Accor — Global hotel group operating a portfolio of hospitality brands worldwide.
 *
 * Accor is a France-based multinational hospitality group headquartered near
 * Paris. It operates and franchises hotels, resorts, and residences across
 * economy to luxury segments under brands including Sofitel, Novotel,
 * Mercure, ibis, Fairmont, and Raffles.
 *
 * Sector: Hospitality. HQ: Issy-les-Moulineaux, Ile-de-France, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Accor`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Accor`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
