/**
 * Azumuta — Manufacturing SaaS for digital work instructions, quality, and shop-floor operations.
 *
 * Azumuta is a Ghent-based manufacturing-software scale-up helping factories
 * digitalize operations, improve efficiency, and manage quality and safety.
 * Its Recruitee board at azumuta.recruitee.com listed 6 offers, mostly
 * product-engineering roles in Gent plus a sales role in the Netherlands.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Manufacturing SaaS. HQ: Ghent, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `azumuta`
 * (`https://azumuta.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
