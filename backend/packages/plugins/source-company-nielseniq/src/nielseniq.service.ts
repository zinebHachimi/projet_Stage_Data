/**
 * NielsenIQ — Consumer intelligence company providing retail measurement and analytics.
 *
 * NielsenIQ provides consumer intelligence through retail measurement,
 * market data, and analytics platforms. It builds software and data products
 * that measure consumer purchasing behavior for retailers and manufacturers.
 * The company operates globally.
 *
 * Sector: Consumer intelligence data & analytics technology. HQ: Chicago, Illinois, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `NielsenIQ`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/NielsenIQ`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
