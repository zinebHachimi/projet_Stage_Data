/**
 * VALUEZON — Munich-based e-commerce company focused on Amazon marketplace selling, brand-building and performance marketing.
 *
 * VALUEZON GmbH is a Munich-based e-commerce company that sells products and
 * builds brands on Amazon marketplaces and advises clients on Amazon selling
 * and performance marketing. Its Recruitee board (valuezon.recruitee.com)
 * returned a JSON offers array with roles such as 'Business Manager -
 * E-Commerce (m/w/d)', '(Junior) Performance Marketing Manager' and 'Amazon
 * Marketplace Manager (m/w/d)', all in Munich.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce / Amazon marketplace. HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `valuezon`
 * (`https://valuezon.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
