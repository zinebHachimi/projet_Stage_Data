/**
 * Kepler Communications — In-space data relay network connecting satellites in real time.
 *
 * Kepler Communications is building an optical data relay constellation to
 * provide real-time connectivity for satellites and other space-based
 * assets. It designs and operates its own spacecraft.
 *
 * Sector: Space/Aerospace. HQ: Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `kepler`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/kepler`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
