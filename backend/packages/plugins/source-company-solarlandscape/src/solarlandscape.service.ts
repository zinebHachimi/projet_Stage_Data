/**
 * Solar Landscape — Commercial and community rooftop solar developer building distributed generation and battery storage across the US.
 *
 * Solar Landscape develops, builds, owns, and operates commercial rooftop
 * and community solar projects along with battery energy storage, with
 * offices in Chicago, Baltimore, and New York City and operations across
 * more than a dozen states.
 *
 * Sector: Renewable energy / Solar. HQ: Asbury Park, New Jersey, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `solarlandscape`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/solarlandscape`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
