/**
 * Hillstone Restaurant Group — Full-service restaurant company operating upscale casual dining concepts in the US.
 *
 * Hillstone Restaurant Group is an American full-service restaurant company
 * founded in 1977. It operates a collection of upscale-casual dining
 * restaurants across the United States under brands including Hillstone,
 * Houston's, and R+D Kitchen. It is headquartered in Beverly Hills,
 * California.
 *
 * Sector: Restaurants (Full-Service). HQ: Beverly Hills, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `HillstoneRestaurantGroup`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/HillstoneRestaurantGroup`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
