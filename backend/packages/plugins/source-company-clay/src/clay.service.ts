/**
 * Clay — Data enrichment and go-to-market automation platform for sales teams.
 *
 * Clay is a go-to-market platform that aggregates data from many providers
 * to enrich records and automate outbound and prospecting workflows. It
 * combines data enrichment with AI-assisted research and messaging. The
 * company is headquartered in New York.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / go-to-market software. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `claylabs`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/claylabs`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
