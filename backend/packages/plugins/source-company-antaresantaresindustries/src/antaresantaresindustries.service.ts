/**
 * Antares (Antares Industries) — Builds factory-produced fission microreactors for strategic energy on Earth and in space.
 *
 * Antares is a nuclear energy company developing advanced, factory-produced
 * fission microreactors intended for defense, space, and commercial power.
 * Its reactor program uses TRISO fuel and is designed for transportable
 * deployment. The company has secured US government contracts and reached
 * initial criticality under a Department of Energy pilot program.
 *
 * Sector: Nuclear (Defense & Space Power). HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `antares`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/antares`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
