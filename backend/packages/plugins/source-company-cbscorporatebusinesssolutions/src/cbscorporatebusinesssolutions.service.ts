/**
 * cbs Corporate Business Solutions — Digital end-to-end business-process and SAP transformation solutions.
 *
 * cbs Corporate Business Solutions GmbH delivers digital end-to-end
 * business-process solutions with a focus on SAP consulting, system
 * transformation, and business-process management for manufacturing,
 * automotive, pharma, and life-science industries. It is headquartered in
 * Heidelberg.
 *
 * Sector: Enterprise software / SAP consulting. HQ: Heidelberg, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `cbsconsulting`
 * (`https://cbsconsulting.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
