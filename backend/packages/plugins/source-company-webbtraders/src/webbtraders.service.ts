/**
 * WEBB Traders — Amsterdam proprietary trading firm and market maker in cash equities and derivatives across global exchanges.
 *
 * WEBB Traders BV is a proprietary trading company headquartered in
 * Amsterdam (with a presence in Paris), trading its own capital as a market
 * maker in cash equities and derivatives, including crypto, across global
 * exchanges since 2009. Its Recruitee board (webbtraders.recruitee.com)
 * listed eight roles spanning trading, quantitative, data and software
 * engineering.
 *
 * Sector: Proprietary trading / market making. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `webbtraders`
 * (`https://webbtraders.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
