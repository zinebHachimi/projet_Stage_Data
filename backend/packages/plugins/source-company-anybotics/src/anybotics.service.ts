/**
 * ANYbotics — Builds autonomous legged inspection robots with AI/ML perception.
 *
 * ANYbotics builds the ANYmal legged mobile robot for autonomous industrial
 * inspection, using camera- and LIDAR-based sensing and AI/ML perception for
 * full autonomy in energy, process and utility plants.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / robotics. HQ: Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `anybotics`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/anybotics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
