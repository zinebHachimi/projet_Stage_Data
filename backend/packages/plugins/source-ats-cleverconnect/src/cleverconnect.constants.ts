/**
 * Constants for the CleverConnect career-site platform.
 *
 * CleverConnect (cleverconnect.com, France) is a talent-acquisition vendor whose
 * candidate-facing product is a hosted, branded "Career Site". Every customer tenant
 * publishes a public, unauthenticated career board on its own sub-domain of the
 * shared career-site host, addressed by a tenant label:
 *
 *   https://career.{tenant}.cleverconnect.com/jobs        (candidate-facing board)
 *
 * The board is an Angular single-page application, but the server pre-renders the
 * full open-roles payload into the initial HTML document as an Angular
 * **TransferState** hydration blob (a JSON island whose double-quotes are
 * HTML-entity-encoded as `&q;`, ampersands as `&a;`, `<`/`>` as `&l;`/`&g;`, single
 * quotes as `&s;`). Decoding that blob yields a JSON array of fully-structured offer
 * objects — so the adapter never needs the SPA's runtime XHR API (which is not a
 * stable public surface), it just decodes and parses the embedded payload.
 *
 * Each embedded offer object carries (all fields optional / defensively narrowed):
 *   - `id`            CleverConnect offer id (string of digits) — the stable ATS id
 *   - `title`         role title
 *   - `description`   HTML job body
 *   - `companyDescription` HTML about-the-company text (fallback body)
 *   - `locality`      free-text location, e.g. "Guebwiller (68) - Grand Est"
 *   - `publicationDate` ISO-8601 publication timestamp → `datePosted`
 *   - `recruiter` / `publisher` hiring company display name
 *   - `permanent`     boolean permanence flag
 *   - `url.jobOffer`  canonical detail path `/candidat/offres/…-{id}`
 *   - `url.jobOfferShort` short stable detail path `/jobads/{id}`
 *   - `url.redirect`  optional external apply URL (the tenant's underlying ATS)
 *   - `labels.contractTypeList[]` employment-type tokens (e.g. "CDI")
 *   - `labels.macroJobList[]` / `labels.jobList[]` job-family / department tokens
 *   - `status`        publication status ("PUBLISHED")
 *
 * Each offer object opens with `{"score":…,"temperature":…,"id":"{id}",…}` — that
 * `{"score":` token is the stable per-offer boundary the adapter anchors on (rather
 * than a nested field such as `jobOfferShort`, which sits in the inner `url` object).
 *
 * Each role's canonical public detail / apply URL is the short `/jobads/{id}` path on
 * the same tenant host:
 *
 *   https://career.{tenant}.cleverconnect.com/jobads/{id}
 *
 * The caller addresses a tenant by `companySlug` (the sub-domain label, e.g. `demo`)
 * or by `companyUrl` (a career-site URL on a `cleverconnect.com` host, from which the
 * tenant label is derived). An unknown tenant resolves to a host with no DNS record /
 * an empty board, so it degrades naturally to an empty result. A fetch error, an HTTP
 * 4xx, a DNS failure, or a malformed / un-decodable body degrades to an empty /
 * partial result rather than throwing, so a single bad tenant never breaks a batch run.
 *
 * Surface confidence (researched + verified live 2026-06-03, no authentication):
 *  - Confirmed the platform + tenant addressing
 *    (`career.{tenant}.cleverconnect.com/jobs`) and a real, named live tenant on it:
 *    `demo` (the CleverConnect demo career site, 20 open roles at time of research).
 *  - Confirmed the server pre-renders the full offer array as an Angular
 *    TransferState JSON blob (entity-encoded), each offer carrying the numeric `id`
 *    (the stable ATS id), `title`, `description` (HTML), `locality`,
 *    `recruiter`/`publisher`, `publicationDate`, `url.jobOffer` /
 *    `url.jobOfferShort` (`/jobads/{id}`), and `labels.contractTypeList` /
 *    `labels.macroJobList` (verified=true).
