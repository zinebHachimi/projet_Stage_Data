/**
 * Cognition — Builds AI software-engineering agents, including Devin.
 *
 * Cognition develops AI agents for software engineering, including the Devin
 * coding agent. Its products assist with autonomous and collaborative coding
 * tasks.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / developer tools. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `cognition`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/cognition`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
