/**
 * Eataly — Italian food marketplace combining grocery retail, restaurants, and cafes.
 *
 * Eataly is a large-format Italian food and beverage marketplace that
 * combines grocery retail with restaurants, cafes, and to-go counters under
 * one roof. Eataly North America operates locations across the United States
 * and Canada, hiring for culinary, retail, and food-service roles.
 *
 * Sector: Food & Beverage Retail / Restaurants. HQ: New York, New York, USA (North America).
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Eataly`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Eataly`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
