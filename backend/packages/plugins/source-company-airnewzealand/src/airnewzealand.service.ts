/**
 * Air New Zealand — New Zealand\'s flag carrier airline, operating domestic and international passenger and cargo services.
 *
 * Air New Zealand is the flag carrier airline of New Zealand, headquartered
 * in Auckland. It provides domestic and international passenger flights
 * along with cargo services across the Pacific, Asia, North America, and
 * beyond.
 *
 * Sector: Airlines. HQ: Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `airnewzealand`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/airnewzealand`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
