/**
 * Aikido Security — Application security platform (SAST, DAST, cloud/container scanning) for developers.
 *
 * Aikido Security is a Ghent-based software security company offering a
 * developer-focused platform that consolidates code, cloud, and container
 * security scanning. Its Recruitee board at aikidosecurity.recruitee.com
 * listed 11 open roles across engineering, sales, customer success, and
 * operations.
 *
 * Sector: Software / Cybersecurity. HQ: Ghent, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `aikidosecurity`
 * (`https://aikidosecurity.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
