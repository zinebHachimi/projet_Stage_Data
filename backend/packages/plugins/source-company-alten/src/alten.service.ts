/**
 * ALTEN — Engineering and technology consultancy serving automotive, aerospace, energy, and industrial sectors.
 *
 * ALTEN is a France-headquartered engineering and technology consulting
 * group. It delivers R&D and IT engineering services to clients in the
 * automotive, aerospace, energy, rail, and industrial equipment sectors.
 *
 * Sector: Engineering & technology consulting. HQ: Boulogne-Billancourt, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ALTEN`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ALTEN`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
