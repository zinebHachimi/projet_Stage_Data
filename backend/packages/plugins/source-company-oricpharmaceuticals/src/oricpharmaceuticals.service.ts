/**
 * ORIC Pharmaceuticals — Clinical-stage oncology company developing therapies to overcome cancer treatment resistance.
 *
 * ORIC Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company
 * developing treatments designed to address mechanisms of therapeutic
 * resistance in cancer. Its pipeline targets tumor types including prostate
 * and lung cancers. It is headquartered in South San Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals. HQ: South San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ORICPharmaceuticals`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ORICPharmaceuticals`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
