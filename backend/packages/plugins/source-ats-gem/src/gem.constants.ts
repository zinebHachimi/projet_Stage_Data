 * so a future contributor can `git diff` the two surfaces and
 * convince themselves the wire shape matches: the batched POST
 * carries both `JobBoardTheme` and `JobBoardList` operations, the
 * `batch: 'true'` header is what flips the server into batched
 * mode, and the operation order in the request payload matches the
 * upstream snippet exactly (Theme first, List second).
 *
 * Response-order tolerance is handled inside `GemService` itself —
 * the wire request is fixed; the server is allowed to reorder the
 * operations in its response and the parser picks the array entry
 * whose `data.oatsExternalJobPostings` is defined.
