/**
 * Global Lending Services — Auto finance company providing subprime and near-prime vehicle loans through dealerships.
 *
 * Global Lending Services (GLS) provides auto financing, specializing in
 * subprime and near-prime vehicle loans originated through a national
 * dealership network. It operates the glsauto.com platform.
 *
 * Sector: Auto Lending. HQ: Greenville, South Carolina, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `glsllc`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/glsllc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
