/**
 * Allegis Global Solutions — Workforce solutions provider delivering RPO and managed services programs.
 *
 * Allegis Global Solutions is a workforce solutions provider offering
 * recruitment process outsourcing (RPO), managed service programs (MSP) and
 * workforce advisory services. It is part of Allegis Group and operates
 * globally.
 *
 * Sector: Workforce solutions / RPO and MSP. HQ: Hanover, Maryland, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AllegisGlobalSolutions`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AllegisGlobalSolutions`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
