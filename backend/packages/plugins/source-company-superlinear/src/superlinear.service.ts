/**
 * Superlinear — AI and optimization consultancy building enterprise orchestration technology.
 *
 * Superlinear is a Brussels-based AI, data, and optimization technology
 * company. Its Recruitee board at superlinear.recruitee.com listed 6 offers,
 * all Brussels-based, including several forward-deployed engineer roles
 * (cloud, data, optimization).
 *
 * Sector: Software / AI consultancy. HQ: Brussels, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `superlinear`
 * (`https://superlinear.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
