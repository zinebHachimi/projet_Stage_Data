/**
 * Lendbuzz — AI-based auto lending platform financing consumers through dealerships.
 *
 * Lendbuzz is a fintech company that uses AI and alternative data to provide
 * auto financing to consumers, including those with limited US credit
 * history, through a dealership network.
 *
 * Sector: Auto Lending / Fintech. HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `lendbuzz`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/lendbuzz`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
