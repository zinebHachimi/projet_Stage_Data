/**
 * Creative Clicks — Performance-marketing and mobile advertising company operating across digital acquisition channels.
 *
 * Creative Clicks is an Amsterdam-based performance-marketing and adtech
 * company working on digital customer-acquisition and mobile advertising.
 * The Recruitee board creativeclicks.recruitee.com returned 8 live offers,
 * mostly Amsterdam internships and freelance roles (AI product, digital
 * marketing, operations, UX/UI) plus a Toronto account-management position.
 *
 * Sector: Performance marketing / adtech (e-commerce adjacent). HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `creativeclicks`
 * (`https://creativeclicks.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
