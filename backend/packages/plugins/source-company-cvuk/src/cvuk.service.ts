/**
 * CVUK — UK recruitment consultancy specialising in fashion and retail talent.
 *
 * CVUK is a United Kingdom recruitment consultancy focused on the fashion
 * and retail sectors. It places permanent, contract and freelance talent
 * across design, buying, merchandising and related roles for brands and
 * retailers.
 *
 * Sector: Recruitment (fashion & retail). HQ: United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CVUK`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CVUK`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
