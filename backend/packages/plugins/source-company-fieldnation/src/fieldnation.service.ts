/**
 * Field Nation — Marketplace and workforce management platform connecting businesses with field service technicians.
 *
 * Field Nation operates a SaaS platform and labor marketplace that connects
 * companies needing on-site IT and field service work with independent
 * technicians, plus tools to manage that workforce. It has teams in
 * Minnesota and Dhaka.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Field Service Management. HQ: Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `fieldnation`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/fieldnation`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
