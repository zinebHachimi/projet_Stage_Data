/**
 * Lakeshore Learning Materials — Developer and retailer of educational materials for schools, teachers, and families.
 *
 * Lakeshore Learning Materials is a company that designs, manufactures, and
 * retails educational products and classroom materials for early childhood
 * and K-12 education. It supplies teachers, schools, and families and
 * operates retail stores, distribution centers, and corporate functions.
 *
 * Sector: Education (educational products and materials). HQ: Carson, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Lakeshore`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Lakeshore`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
