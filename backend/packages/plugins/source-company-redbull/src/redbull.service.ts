/**
 * Red Bull — Energy drink company with a large media, sports, esports and entertainment arm.
 *
 * Red Bull is an Austrian company known for its energy drink and for Red
 * Bull Media House, which produces sports, music, gaming and entertainment
 * content. It owns sports teams and runs global events, and hires across
 * marketing, media production, sports and esports.
 *
 * Sector: Media & Entertainment. HQ: Fuschl am See, Salzburg, Austria.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `RedBull`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/RedBull`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
