/**
 * Prefect — Workflow orchestration platform for data and machine learning pipelines.
 *
 * Prefect builds a workflow orchestration platform for data and machine
 * learning engineers, enabling the scheduling, execution, and monitoring of
 * Python-based pipelines. It offers an open-source framework and a managed
 * cloud service.
 *
 * Sector: Data infrastructure / Workflow orchestration. HQ: Washington, D.C., USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `prefect`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/prefect`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
