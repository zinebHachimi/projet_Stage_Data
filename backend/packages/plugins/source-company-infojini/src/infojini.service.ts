/**
 * Infojini — IT consulting, services and staffing firm serving government and commercial clients.
 *
 * Infojini is a full-service IT consulting, services and staffing firm that
 * serves government agencies and commercial clients, including state and
 * federal agencies and large enterprises. It provides technology talent and
 * project services.
 *
 * Sector: IT consulting and staffing. HQ: Secaucus, New Jersey, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `InfojiniInc1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/InfojiniInc1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
