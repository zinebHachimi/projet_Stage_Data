/**
 * Finni Health — Platform enabling autism care providers to start and run their own ABA practices.
 *
 * Finni Health provides technology and back-office support that lets autism
 * care (ABA) providers launch and operate independent practices. It handles
 * administrative functions such as credentialing, billing, and insurance.
 * The company supports clinicians delivering applied behavior analysis
 * therapy.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (autism / ABA care). HQ: San Francisco, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `finni-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/finni-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
