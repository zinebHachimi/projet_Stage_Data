/**
 * Radiant Industries — Develops portable microreactors to provide clean power for remote and off-grid sites.
 *
 * Radiant Industries is developing a portable nuclear microreactor designed
 * to be transported and deployed to provide power in remote locations and to
 * replace diesel generators. The reactor is intended to be factory-produced
 * and moved by truck, ship, or plane. The company is based in El Segundo,
 * California.
 *
 * Sector: Nuclear microreactors. HQ: El Segundo, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `radiant-industries`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/radiant-industries`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
