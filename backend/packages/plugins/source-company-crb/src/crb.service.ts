/**
 * CRB — Engineering, architecture, and construction firm serving life sciences and advanced technology facilities.
 *
 * CRB is a provider of sustainable engineering, architecture, construction,
 * and consulting services. It focuses on the life sciences and advanced
 * technology industries, delivering facilities for pharmaceutical, biotech,
 * and food and beverage clients. The company is headquartered in Kansas
 * City, Missouri.
 *
 * Sector: Engineering, Architecture & Construction. HQ: Kansas City, Missouri, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CRB`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CRB`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
