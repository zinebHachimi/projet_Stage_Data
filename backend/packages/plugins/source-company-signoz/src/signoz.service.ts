/**
 * SigNoz — Open-source, OpenTelemetry-native observability platform.
 *
 * SigNoz builds an open-source observability platform based on OpenTelemetry
 * that provides application monitoring, metrics, logs, and traces. It
 * reports over 27,000 GitHub stars and 800+ customers. The company hires
 * across engineering, product, design, customer success, growth, and
 * developer relations.
 *
 * Sector: Observability. HQ: Remote (US and India).
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `signoz`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/signoz`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
