/**
 * Spotify — Audio streaming company that also builds Backstage, an enterprise developer platform.
 *
 * Spotify operates a global audio streaming service and, through Backstage,
 * offers an internal developer portal platform used by engineering
 * organizations. This Lever board carries roles across advertising, finance,
 * analytics, and Backstage.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Developer Platforms & Media. HQ: Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `spotify`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/spotify`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
