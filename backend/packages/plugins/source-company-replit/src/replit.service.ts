/**
 * Replit — Browser-based coding platform with AI-assisted development.
 *
 * Replit provides a browser-based software development environment with
 * integrated AI features for building, editing, and deploying applications.
 * It serves individual developers and teams.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / developer tools. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `replit`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/replit`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
