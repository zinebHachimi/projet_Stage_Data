/**
 * Polymarket — Onchain prediction market platform where users trade on real-world event outcomes.
 *
 * Polymarket operates an onchain prediction market where users trade on the
 * outcomes of real-world events. Its systems sit between the product and the
 * blockchain, handling distributed systems and high-throughput backend work.
 * The platform settles trades onchain.
 *
 * Sector: Onchain prediction markets. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `polymarket`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/polymarket`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
