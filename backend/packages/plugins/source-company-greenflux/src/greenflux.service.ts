/**
 * GreenFlux — Cloud SaaS platform for managing EV charging networks and smart-charging operations.
 *
 * GreenFlux is an Amsterdam-based provider of a cloud platform for managing
 * electric-vehicle charging infrastructure, including charge-point
 * management, smart charging and roaming. The Recruitee board
 * greenflux.recruitee.com returned 5 live offers, all Amsterdam-based
 * (product management, finance, customer success and solutions roles).
 *
 * Sector: EV-charging SaaS (retail-tech adjacent). HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `greenflux`
 * (`https://greenflux.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
