/**
 * Inspiration Commerce Group — Operator of a portfolio of e-commerce and consumer brands.
 *
 * Inspiration Commerce Group operates a portfolio of e-commerce and consumer
 * businesses. Its open roles span e-commerce operations, personal shopping,
 * sales, and finance. The company hosts its careers page on Ashby.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce / consumer brands. HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `inspiration-commerce-group`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/inspiration-commerce-group`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
