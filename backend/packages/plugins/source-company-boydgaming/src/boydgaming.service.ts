/**
 * Boyd Gaming — US casino and gaming entertainment operator.
 *
 * Boyd Gaming Corporation is a casino entertainment company that owns and
 * operates gaming, hospitality and entertainment properties across multiple
 * US states. It hires for casino operations, hospitality, food and beverage,
 * and corporate roles.
 *
 * Sector: Gaming & Casino Entertainment. HQ: Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `BoydGaming`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/BoydGaming`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
