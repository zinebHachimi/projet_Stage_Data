/**
 * Intuitive Surgical — Manufacturer of robotic-assisted surgical systems and related instruments.
 *
 * Intuitive Surgical, Inc. develops and manufactures robotic-assisted
 * surgical systems, including the da Vinci surgical platform and Ion
 * endoluminal system, along with associated instruments and accessories.
 *
 * Sector: Medical device manufacturing / Robotics. HQ: Sunnyvale, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Intuitive`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Intuitive`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
