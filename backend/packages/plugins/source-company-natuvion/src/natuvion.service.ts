/**
 * Natuvion — Software and services for migrating business-critical data and processes between platforms.
 *
 * Natuvion GmbH describes itself as a digital moving company that transports
 * business-critical data and processes between technology platforms,
 * focusing on SAP data migration, transformation, integration, security, and
 * quality assurance.
 *
 * Sector: Enterprise software / SAP services. HQ: Walldorf, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `natuvion`
 * (`https://natuvion.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
