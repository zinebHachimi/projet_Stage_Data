/**
 * Adaptive Security — AI-powered cybersecurity platform defending against deepfakes and AI-driven social engineering.
 *
 * Adaptive Security builds AI-powered cybersecurity products that protect
 * organizations from threats including deepfakes, voice scams, and AI-driven
 * social engineering. Its products integrate with enterprise platforms such
 * as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365. The company raised an $81M Series B
 * in December 2025.
 *
 * Sector: AI Cybersecurity. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `adaptivesecurity`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/adaptivesecurity`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
