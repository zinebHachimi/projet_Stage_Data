/**
 * Avalere Health — Health-focused advisory, medical communications, and marketing services group for life sciences.
 *
 * Avalere Health provides advisory, medical communications, and marketing
 * services to pharmaceutical and life-sciences clients across advisory,
 * medical, and marketing practice areas.
 *
 * Sector: Health Tech / Life Sciences Services. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `avalerehealth`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/avalerehealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
