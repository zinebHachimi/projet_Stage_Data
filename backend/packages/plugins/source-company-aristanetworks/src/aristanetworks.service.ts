/**
 * Arista Networks — Provider of cloud and data-center networking solutions.
 *
 * Arista Networks provides data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for data
 * center, campus, and routing environments. Its products combine
 * high-performance switches with the EOS network operating system. It serves
 * large enterprise and cloud customers.
 *
 * Sector: Networking technology / software-driven networking. HQ: Santa Clara, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `aristanetworks`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/aristanetworks`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
