/**
 * City Furniture — Home furnishings retailer operating furniture showrooms in Florida.
 *
 * City Furniture is a home furnishings retailer operating showrooms across
 * Florida, including Ashley HomeStore locations. It sells furniture,
 * mattresses, and home decor through physical stores and e-commerce. The
 * company is a major furniture retailer in the South Florida market.
 *
 * Sector: Home furnishings retail. HQ: Tamarac, Florida, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CityFurniture1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CityFurniture1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
