/**
 * The Nielsen Company — Audience measurement and media analytics company.
 *
 * Nielsen is a measurement and data analytics company that measures
 * audiences across television, digital and other media, providing viewership
 * and audience data used by the media and advertising industries. It hires
 * across data operations, analytics, engineering and commercial roles.
 *
 * Sector: Media Measurement & Analytics. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `TheNielsenCompany`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/TheNielsenCompany`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
