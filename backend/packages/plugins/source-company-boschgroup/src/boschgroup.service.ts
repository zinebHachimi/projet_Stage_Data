/**
 * Bosch Group — Global technology and engineering company spanning mobility, industrial, and software.
 *
 * Bosch is a technology and engineering company operating across mobility
 * solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and energy/building
 * technology. It develops software, IoT, and automation systems alongside
 * its hardware businesses. It employs a large global workforce.
 *
 * Sector: Technology and engineering (industrial, mobility, software). HQ: Gerlingen, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `BoschGroup`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/BoschGroup`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
