/**
 * Spectrum Health Care — Canadian provider of home health care, personal support, and community nursing services.
 *
 * Spectrum Health Care is a Canadian home and community health care provider
 * delivering nursing, personal support, and related services to clients in
 * their homes and in the community. It operates across Ontario. The
 * organization supports seniors and patients requiring in-home care.
 *
 * Sector: Home Health Care. HQ: Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SpectrumHealthCare`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SpectrumHealthCare`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
