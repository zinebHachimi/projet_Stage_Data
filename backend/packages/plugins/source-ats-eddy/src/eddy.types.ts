/**
 * TypeScript interfaces for the Eddy public careers surface.
 *
 * Eddy tenant careers boards (`https://app.eddy.com/careers/{organizationUuid}`) are
 * single-page applications that fetch the open-roles set from a public, anonymous JSON
 * API keyed by the organization UUID:
 *
 *   GET /api/ats/public/job-opening/organization/{organizationUuid}
 *       → array of lightweight list records (`EddyJobListItem`).
 *   GET /api/ats/public/job-opening/{jobOpeningUuid}/organization/{organizationUuid}
 *       → per-role detail (`EddyJobDetail`) enriching a list record.
 *
 * The interfaces below describe the subset of that wire shape the adapter reads plus the
 * normalised internal role assembled from it. Everything the adapter reads is optional and
 * defensively narrowed at parse time, so cross-tenant or future-shape drift never breaks
 * the parser.
 */

 * lightweight — it carries IDs (not resolved names) for department / location; the

 * Only the fields the adapter consumes are modelled; all are optional and defensively
 * narrowed.
