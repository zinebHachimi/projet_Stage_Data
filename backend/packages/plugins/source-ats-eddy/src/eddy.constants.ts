/**
 * Constants for the Eddy careers platform.
 *
 * Eddy (eddy.com / eddyhr.com — a US small-business HR suite with an applicant-tracking
 * module) hosts every customer tenant's public, unauthenticated candidate-facing careers
 * board on the shared application host `https://app.eddy.com`, addressed by the tenant's
 * **organization UUID**:
 *
 *   https://app.eddy.com/careers/{organizationUuid}                  (careers board shell)
 *   https://app.eddy.com/careers/{organizationUuid}/{jobOpeningUuid} (per-role detail / apply)
 *
 * The careers board is a single-page application: the open roles are NOT embedded in the
 * landing HTML. The page fetches them from a public, anonymous JSON API keyed by the
 * organization UUID:
 *
 *   GET https://app.eddy.com/api/ats/public/job-opening/organization/{organizationUuid}
 *       → JSON array of open roles, each:
 *           { jobOpeningUuid, title, departmentId, locationId, postedDate }
 *
 *   GET https://app.eddy.com/api/ats/public/job-opening/{jobOpeningUuid}/organization/{organizationUuid}
 *       → per-role detail enriching the list record with:
 *           { title, employmentType, experience, description (HTML), postedDate,
 *             compensation, departmentId, locationId, workplaceType, publishToCareers }
 *
 * The adapter calls the list endpoint, maps each role from the list record, and (best
 * effort, bounded) fans out to the per-role detail endpoint to enrich the description,
 * employmentType, and workplaceType — rather than depending on a client-rendered DOM, a
 * headless browser, or an authenticated REST API.
 *
 * The caller addresses a tenant by `companySlug` (the organization UUID) or by
 * `companyUrl` (a careers URL on the `app.eddy.com` host whose first `/careers/{…}` path
 * segment is the organization UUID). An unknown tenant, a tenant with no open roles, or
 * an empty board degrades naturally to an empty result. A fetch error, an HTTP 4xx, a DNS
 * failure, or a malformed body degrades to an empty / partial result rather than
 * throwing, so a single bad tenant never nukes a batch run.
 *
 * Surface confidence (researched + verified live 2026-06-03, no authentication):
 *  - Confirmed the platform + the careers host `app.eddy.com`, and that the careers SPA
 *    bundle (`/careers/assets/main-*.js`) builds its data calls against
 *    `/api/ats/public/job-opening/organization/{organizationUuid}` (list) and
 *    `/api/ats/public/job-opening/{jobOpeningUuid}/organization/{organizationUuid}`
 *    (detail).
 *  - Confirmed both public endpoints answer anonymously and strictly require the
 *    **organization UUID** (passing a human-readable vanity slug yields a 400
 *    "Failed to convert 'organizationUuid'"). A real org UUID returned HTTP 200 with a
 *    JSON role array; a real per-role detail returned HTTP 200 with the role body shape
 *    above. Empty orgs return `[]`, exercising the empty-board path. verified=true.
