/**
 * Distribusion Technologies — B2B technology marketplace connecting ground-transport operators with online retailers.
 *
 * Distribusion Technologies GmbH runs a B2B technology platform and
 * marketplace that connects bus, rail, and ferry operators in 70+ countries
 * with online retailers, providing search-to-ticket-purchase access to
 * ground transportation. It is headquartered in Berlin.
 *
 * Sector: Mobility / travel-tech platform. HQ: Berlin, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `distribusion`
 * (`https://distribusion.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
