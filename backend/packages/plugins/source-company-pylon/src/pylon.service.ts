/**
 * Pylon — An API platform for embedding mortgage origination and lending.
 *
 * Pylon is a fintech infrastructure company that lets businesses embed
 * mortgage lending into their products via APIs, handling origination,
 * underwriting, processing, funding, and closing. It was founded in 2022 and
 * offers products including conventional, FHA, VA, and jumbo loans.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Embedded mortgage lending. HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `pylon`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/pylon`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
