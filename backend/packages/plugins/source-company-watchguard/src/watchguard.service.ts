/**
 * WatchGuard Technologies — Provides network security, endpoint protection, identity, SASE, and secure Wi-Fi products.
 *
 * WatchGuard Technologies is a cybersecurity company delivering network
 * security, endpoint protection, identity, SASE, and secure Wi-Fi solutions,
 * largely through managed service providers and partners. It hires
 * engineering and go-to-market roles internationally.
 *
 * Sector: Cloud / network security infrastructure. HQ: Seattle, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `watchguard`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/watchguard`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
