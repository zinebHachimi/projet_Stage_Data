/**
 * Relay Robotics — Autonomous service robots for hotels, hospitals, and multi-tenant buildings.
 *
 * Relay Robotics builds autonomous mobile robots that make deliveries in
 * indoor commercial environments such as hotels and residential buildings,
 * navigating elevators and hallways without human assistance.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics. HQ: Campbell, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `relayrobotics.com`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/relayrobotics.com`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
