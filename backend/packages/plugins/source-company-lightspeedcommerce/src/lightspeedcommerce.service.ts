/**
 * Lightspeed Commerce — Cloud-based point-of-sale and commerce platform for retail, restaurant, and hospitality businesses.
 *
 * Lightspeed Commerce is a publicly traded company that provides a cloud
 * commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses. Its software
 * combines point-of-sale, payments, inventory management, and e-commerce for
 * retailers and restaurants. The company is headquartered in Montreal and
 * operates in multiple countries.
 *
 * Sector: Retail tech / commerce platform. HQ: Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `lightspeedhq`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/lightspeedhq`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
