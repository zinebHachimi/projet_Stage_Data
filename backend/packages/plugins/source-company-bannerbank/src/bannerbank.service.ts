/**
 * Banner Bank — Regional commercial bank serving the Pacific Northwest and California.
 *
 * Banner Bank is a regional commercial bank offering personal and business
 * banking, lending, mortgage, and deposit services through branches across
 * the Pacific Northwest and Northern California.
 *
 * Sector: Banking. HQ: Walla Walla, Washington, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `bannerbank`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/bannerbank`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
