/**
 * bunq — Amsterdam-based mobile neobank offering personal and business banking across Europe.
 *
 * bunq is a Dutch digital bank founded in 2012 and headquartered in
 * Amsterdam, holding a European banking licence. It operates a mobile-first
 * banking app with personal and business accounts, cards, savings and
 * multi-currency features, and is one of the larger EU neobanks by user
 * base. Its Recruitee board (bunq.recruitee.com) lists banking, risk, legal
 * and operations roles in Amsterdam.
 *
 * Sector: Neobank / digital banking. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `bunq`
 * (`https://bunq.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
