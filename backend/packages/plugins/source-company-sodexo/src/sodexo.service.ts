/**
 * Sodexo — Global provider of food services and integrated facilities management.
 *
 * Sodexo is a France-headquartered multinational company providing food
 * services and integrated facilities management. Its offerings include
 * corporate and institutional catering, cafeteria and dining operations, and
 * food service across healthcare, education, and business sites worldwide.
 *
 * Sector: Food Services & Facilities Management. HQ: Issy-les-Moulineaux, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Sodexo`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Sodexo`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
