/**
 * UP42 — Geospatial marketplace and platform for ordering and analyzing Earth-observation data.
 *
 * UP42 GmbH, founded in 2019 and headquartered in Berlin, runs a platform
 * that aggregates satellite imagery and geospatial datasets so organizations
 * can order, access, and analyze Earth-observation data. Since July 2025 it
 * has been part of Neo Space Group.
 *
 * Sector: Geospatial data platform / SaaS. HQ: Berlin, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `up42gmbh`
 * (`https://up42gmbh.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
