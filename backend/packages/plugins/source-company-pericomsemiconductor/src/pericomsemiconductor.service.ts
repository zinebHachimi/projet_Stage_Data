/**
 * Pericom Semiconductor — Semiconductor company producing connectivity, timing, and signal integrity ICs.
 *
 * Pericom Semiconductor Corporation designs and manufactures integrated
 * circuits for connectivity, timing, and signal integrity applications. Its
 * products are used in computing, communications, and consumer electronics.
 * It is now part of Diodes Incorporated.
 *
 * Sector: Semiconductors. HQ: Milpitas, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `PericomSemiconductorCorporation`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/PericomSemiconductorCorporation`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
