/**
 * Solutions 4 Delivery — SaaS platform for online food ordering and delivery aimed at quick-service restaurant chains.
 *
 * Solutions 4 Delivery is an Amsterdam-based company providing a SaaS
 * online-ordering and delivery platform for quick-service restaurant chains,
 * covering webshop/ordering, logistics and customer operations. Its board
 * solutions4delivery.recruitee.com redirects to the slug s4d.recruitee.com,
 * which returned 10 live offers across operations, growth and product, all
 * in Amsterdam.
 *
 * Sector: Food e-commerce / delivery SaaS. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `s4d`
 * (`https://s4d.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
