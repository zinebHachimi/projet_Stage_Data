/**
 * County of Grande Prairie No. 1 — Municipal district government in Alberta, Canada.
 *
 * The County of Grande Prairie No. 1 is a municipal district government in
 * Alberta, Canada. It provides local-government services such as public
 * works, infrastructure, and community services, and hires operational and
 * administrative staff including equipment operators.
 *
 * Sector: Government / public sector (local government). HQ: Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CountyOfGrandePrairieNo1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CountyOfGrandePrairieNo1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
