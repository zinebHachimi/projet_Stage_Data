/**
 * Perplexity — AI-powered answer engine that responds to queries with cited sources.
 *
 * Perplexity operates a conversational answer engine that uses large
 * language models to respond to user questions with citations to web
 * sources. It offers consumer and enterprise products and a developer API.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / search. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `perplexity`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/perplexity`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
