/**
 * Swiss Hospitality — Hospitality management company operating hotel and service businesses.
 *
 * Swiss Hospitality is a hospitality management company that operates and
 * supports hotel and hospitality service businesses. It recruits for roles
 * across hotel operations and guest services.
 *
 * Sector: Hospitality. HQ: Switzerland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SwissHospitality`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SwissHospitality`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
