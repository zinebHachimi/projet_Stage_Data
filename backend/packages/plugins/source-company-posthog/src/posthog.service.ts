/**
 * PostHog — Open-source product analytics, session replay, feature flags, and experimentation platform.
 *
 * PostHog is a product-analytics and developer platform that combines
 * product analytics, session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and
 * surveys. It offers an open-source edition alongside a hosted cloud
 * product. The company is remote-first with a US headquarters in San
 * Francisco.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / product analytics & developer tools. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `posthog`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/posthog`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
