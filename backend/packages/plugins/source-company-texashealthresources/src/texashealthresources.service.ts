/**
 * Texas Health Resources — Faith-based, non-profit health system serving north Texas.
 *
 * Texas Health Resources is a non-profit, faith-based health system
 * operating hospitals, outpatient facilities, and physician groups across
 * the Dallas-Fort Worth area of north Texas. It provides acute, specialty,
 * and community care.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Arlington, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `TexasHealthResources`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/TexasHealthResources`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
