/**
 * Deliveroo — Online marketplace connecting consumers with restaurants and grocery stores for delivery.
 *
 * Deliveroo is an online food and grocery delivery marketplace that connects
 * consumers with local restaurants and shops. Riders deliver orders placed
 * through its app and website. The company is headquartered in London and
 * operates across several countries.
 *
 * Sector: Food & grocery delivery marketplace. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `deliveroo`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/deliveroo`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
