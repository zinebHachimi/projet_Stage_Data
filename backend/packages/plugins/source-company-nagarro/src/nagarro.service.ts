/**
 * Nagarro — Global digital engineering and IT services company serving public-sector and commercial clients.
 *
 * Nagarro is a global digital engineering and IT services company that
 * builds software and digital products for clients across industries,
 * including a State, Local Government, Non-Profit and Education (SLED)
 * public-sector segment. It hires engineers, consultants, and account roles
 * worldwide.
 *
 * Sector: Government contractors / public sector (digital engineering and IT services). HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Nagarro1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Nagarro1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
