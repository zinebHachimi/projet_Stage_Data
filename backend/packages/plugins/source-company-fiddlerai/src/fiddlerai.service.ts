/**
 * Fiddler AI — AI observability and model monitoring platform.
 *
 * Fiddler AI builds an AI observability platform for monitoring, explaining,
 * and analyzing machine learning models and AI systems. The company hires
 * across Marketing, Engineering, and Customer Success, including remote
 * roles in the US.
 *
 * Sector: AI Observability. HQ: Palo Alto, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `fiddler-ai`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/fiddler-ai`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
