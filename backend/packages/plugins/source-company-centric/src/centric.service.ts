/**
 * Centric — IT services and software provider delivering software solutions, consulting, and outsourcing.
 *
 * Centric is a Dutch IT company providing software solutions, IT services,
 * consulting, and outsourcing across sectors, including work on the
 * Thinkwise low-code platform. It hires across consulting, development, and
 * support roles in the Netherlands.
 *
 * Sector: IT services / enterprise software. HQ: Gouda, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `centric`
 * (`https://centric.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
