/**
 * AIM Intelligent Machines — Develops autonomy software that operates heavy equipment across construction and defense.
 *
 * AIM Intelligent Machines builds an autonomy platform that runs existing
 * heavy earthmoving machinery, initially in construction and mining and
 * expanding into defense applications. Its system provides AI-driven
 * perception and control for equipment fleets. The company has received a US
 * Air Force contract for autonomous construction.
 *
 * Sector: Defense & Autonomy. HQ: Seattle, Washington, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `aim`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/aim`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
