/**
 * Constants for the Harri hospitality hiring platform.
 *
 * Harri (harri.com) is an all-in-one workforce management and talent acquisition
 * platform built for the hospitality and service industries. Each employer tenant
 * is addressed by a short slug (the "employer slug") and their public careers page
 * is served at:
 *
 *   https://harri.com/{employerSlug}
 *
 * For example, `https://harri.com/riverstation-careers` is the public careers page
 * for Riverstation restaurant, and `https://harri.com/HHospitality` is Hogsalt
 * Hospitality's page.
 *
 * Wire surface — public anonymous HTML-only:
 *
 *   Harri's employer pages are rendered by an Angular SPA. The underlying JSON API
 *   the Angular app calls requires authentication tokens and is deliberately NOT
 *   used. The public-facing HTML rendered at `harri.com/{slug}` lists open job
 *   positions as anchor-tag links using the pattern:
 *
 *     /{employerSlug}/job/{jobId}-{titleSlug}
 *
 *   e.g. `/riverstation-careers/job/2734396-deputy-general-manager`
 *
 *   We:
 *     1. Fetch the employer's careers page at `HARRI_HOST/{employerSlug}` and
 *        extract all job-link hrefs using {@link HARRI_JOB_HREF_REGEX}.
 *     2. Fan out with a bounded `Promise.allSettled` to each job-detail page at
 *        `HARRI_HOST/{employerSlug}/job/{jobId}-{titleSlug}`.
 *     3. Parse job title, location, description, employment type, pay, and remote
 *        status from the server-rendered HTML on each detail page using meta tags
 *        and heuristic extraction.
 *
 *   The job-detail page at `harri.com/{slug}/job/{id}-{titleSlug}` is server-
 *   rendered HTML that includes Open Graph meta tags (`og:title`, `og:description`)
 *   with the job title and location, and a structured HTML body with the full
 *   job description.
 *
 *   Apply URLs follow the pattern:
 *     `harri.com/{slug}/job/{jobId}-{titleSlug}/apply/{jobId}`
 *
 * Tenant resolution:
 *   - `input.companySlug` — the employer slug, e.g. `riverstation-careers`.
 *   - `input.companyUrl` — fallback; the first path segment of the URL is used,
 *     e.g. `https://harri.com/riverstation-careers` → `riverstation-careers`.
 *
 * Live verification (2026-06-03):
 *   - `harri.com/riverstation-careers` returned HTTP 200 with 2 job links.
 *   - `harri.com/careers_uk` (Harri's own UK careers page) returned HTTP 200
 *     with 2 job links.
 *   - Job URL pattern `/{slug}/job/{jobId}-{titleSlug}` confirmed on multiple
 *     tenants across the global `harri.com/jobs?page=N` listing.
 *   - No public anonymous JSON API is available; this adapter uses HTML scraping.
 *   - Confidence: heuristic (HTML structure confirmed, detail-page parsing
 *     relies on meta tags and heuristic HTML extraction).
