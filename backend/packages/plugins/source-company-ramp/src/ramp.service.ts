/**
 * Ramp — A finance automation platform offering corporate cards, expense management, bill pay, and treasury tools.
 *
 * Ramp is a financial operations platform that provides corporate cards,
 * expense management, bill payment, procurement, and treasury products for
 * businesses. The company automates finance workflows to help teams control
 * spend. Ramp is backed by investors including Founders Fund, Thrive
 * Capital, and Sequoia.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Spend management & payments. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `ramp`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ramp`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
