/**
 * Elephant Technologies — Technology consulting and engineering services firm (ESN) specializing in QA, DevOps and project delivery.
 *
 * Elephant Technologies is a French technology consulting and
 * engineering-services company (ESN) headquartered in Nantes, providing
 * consultants for quality assurance, project management, DevOps and
 * technical leadership, primarily serving clients in the Nantes region.
 * Careers are hosted on Recruitee at elephanttechnologies.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: IT services / Engineering (ESN). HQ: Nantes, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `elephanttechnologies`
 * (`https://elephanttechnologies.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
