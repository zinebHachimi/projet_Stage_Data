/**
 * StudyPoint — Private tutoring and test-preparation company.
 *
 * StudyPoint is a private tutoring company providing one-on-one test
 * preparation and academic tutoring, both in-person and online, across
 * multiple US markets.
 *
 * Sector: education. HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `studypoint`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/studypoint`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
