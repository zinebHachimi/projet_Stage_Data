/**
 * TOPIC — Embedded systems and software development company serving high-tech industries.
 *
 * TOPIC (TOPIC Embedded Systems / Software Development) is a Best,
 * Noord-Brabant company delivering embedded systems and software development
 * services and products for high-tech industries, hiring software and DevOps
 * engineers.
 *
 * Sector: Embedded systems / software. HQ: Best, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `topicsoftwaredevelopment`
 * (`https://topicsoftwaredevelopment.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
