/**
 * Korsail Energy — Developer of utility-scale solar and energy storage projects in the United States.
 *
 * Korsail Energy is a Denver-based renewable energy developer focused on
 * utility-scale solar and battery storage projects from inception through
 * commercial operation. Its work covers project development and engineering
 * for solar and storage assets.
 *
 * Sector: Solar & Storage Development. HQ: Denver, Colorado, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `KorsailEnergy`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/KorsailEnergy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
