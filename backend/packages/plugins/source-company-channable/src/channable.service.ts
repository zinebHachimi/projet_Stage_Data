/**
 * Channable — Feed-management and PPC-automation SaaS that syndicates e-commerce product data to marketplaces, comparison sites, and affiliate platforms.
 *
 * Channable is a Utrecht-based software platform that lets online retailers
 * and agencies optimize and distribute product feeds to marketplaces,
 * price-comparison engines, affiliate networks, and ad channels, and
 * automate pay-per-click campaigns. The public Recruitee board at
 * channable.recruitee.com returned 3 live offers at verification time
 * (commercial roles across DACH and France).
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce SaaS / feed management. HQ: Utrecht, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `channable`
 * (`https://channable.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
