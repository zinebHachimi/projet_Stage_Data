/**
 * Healthcare Support Staffing — Staffing firm placing clinical and non-clinical professionals across the US healthcare industry.
 *
 * Healthcare Support Staffing is a US staffing company that recruits and
 * places healthcare professionals, including nurses, allied health, and
 * administrative staff, with hospitals, health plans, and other healthcare
 * organizations. It supports both permanent and contract placements.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare Staffing. HQ: Orlando, Florida, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `HealthcareSupportStaffing1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/HealthcareSupportStaffing1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
