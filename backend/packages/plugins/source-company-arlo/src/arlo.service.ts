/**
 * Arlo — Technology-driven health plan operations using AI and underwriting data.
 *
 * Arlo is a healthcare company operating in health plan operations and
 * underwriting, applying AI and data science to member experiences. It hires
 * across engineering, product, data science, and health plan operations. The
 * company is based in New York City.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (health plan / AI). HQ: New York, NY, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `arlo`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/arlo`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
