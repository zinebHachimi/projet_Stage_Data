/**
 * Anagram — Digital assets holding company building and incubating crypto projects.
 *
 * Anagram is a digital assets holding company focused on building and
 * incubating crypto projects. It works on developing decentralized
 * technology across multiple initiatives. The company operates as a builder
 * and incubator in the crypto space.
 *
 * Sector: Crypto holding / incubation. HQ: Remote.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `anagram`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/anagram`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
