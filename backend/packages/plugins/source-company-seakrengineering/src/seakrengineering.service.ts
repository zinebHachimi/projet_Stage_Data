/**
 * SEAKR Engineering — Manufacturer of advanced electronics for space and satellite applications.
 *
 * SEAKR Engineering designs and manufactures advanced electronics for space
 * applications, including onboard processing, memory, and signal-processing
 * systems for satellites and spacecraft.
 *
 * Sector: Aerospace electronics manufacturing. HQ: Centennial, Colorado, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SEAKREngineering`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SEAKREngineering`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
