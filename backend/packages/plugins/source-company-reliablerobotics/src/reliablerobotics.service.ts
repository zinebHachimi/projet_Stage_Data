/**
 * Reliable Robotics — Develops automated flight systems for remotely operated aircraft.
 *
 * Reliable Robotics develops automation systems to enable continuously
 * monitored, remotely operated aircraft. The company builds an aircraft
 * automation platform aimed at cargo and other aviation operations and works
 * with regulators on certification. It is headquartered in Mountain View,
 * California.
 *
 * Sector: Autonomy / Aviation. HQ: Mountain View, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `reliable-robotics`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/reliable-robotics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
