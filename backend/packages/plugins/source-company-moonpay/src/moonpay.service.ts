/**
 * MoonPay — Payments platform for buying, selling, and paying in digital currencies.
 *
 * MoonPay operates a payments infrastructure platform that lets consumers
 * and businesses buy, sell, swap, and pay in digital currencies. It is
 * licensed in the US and regulated across the UK, EU, Canada, and Australia.
 *
 * Sector: Crypto Payments. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `moonpay`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/moonpay`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
