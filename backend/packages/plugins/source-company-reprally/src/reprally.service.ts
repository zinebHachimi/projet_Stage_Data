/**
 * RepRally — Platform connecting independent sales representatives with brands to sell into local retail stores.
 *
 * RepRally operates a platform that connects independent territory sales
 * representatives with consumer brands to place products into local and
 * independent retail stores. It supports the retail distribution and
 * merchandising process through its app. The company hosts its careers page
 * on Ashby.
 *
 * Sector: Retail tech / B2B sales marketplace. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `reprally`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/reprally`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
