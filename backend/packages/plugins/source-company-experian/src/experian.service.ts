/**
 * Experian — Global data and technology company providing credit and analytics services.
 *
 * Experian is a data, analytics, and technology company operating in credit
 * reporting, decisioning, fraud prevention, and marketing analytics. It
 * builds enterprise software and cloud platforms serving financial services
 * and businesses worldwide. It operates across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia
 * Pacific.
 *
 * Sector: Data, analytics and technology services. HQ: Dublin, Ireland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Experian`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Experian`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
