/**
 * Ockto — Naarden-based fintech whose platform lets consumers securely collect and share verified personal/financial data for processes like mortgage applications.
 *
 * Ockto is a Dutch fintech based in Naarden that operates a platform for
 * securely collecting and sharing verified personal and financial data from
 * trusted sources, used in flows such as mortgage applications, rental and
 * private-lease agreements. It cites financial institutions including ING,
 * Aegon and De Hypotheker as users. Its Recruitee board
 * (ockto.recruitee.com) listed engineering, sales and consulting roles with
 * posted salary ranges.
 *
 * Sector: Digital identity / financial data sharing. HQ: Naarden, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `ockto`
 * (`https://ockto.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
