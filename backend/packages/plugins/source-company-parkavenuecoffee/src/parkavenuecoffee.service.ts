/**
 * Park Avenue Coffee — St. Louis coffee and bakery company operating cafes and a bakery.
 *
 * Park Avenue Coffee is a St. Louis, Missouri coffee and bakery business
 * operating cafes and an in-house bakery known for its gooey butter cake. It
 * hires bakers, baristas, and bakery production staff for its local
 * operations.
 *
 * Sector: Food & Beverage (Coffee & Bakery). HQ: St. Louis, Missouri, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `ParkAvenueCoffee`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ParkAvenueCoffee`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
