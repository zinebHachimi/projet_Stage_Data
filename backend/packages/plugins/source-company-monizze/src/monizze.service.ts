/**
 * Monizze — Digital employee-benefits provider (meal, eco, and gift vouchers) via app and card.
 *
 * Monizze is a Brussels-based HR/benefits technology company providing
 * digital employee benefits through a card and app. Its Recruitee board at
 * monizze.recruitee.com listed 6 offers, including Chief Product Officer and
 * product-innovation roles, all Brussels-based.
 *
 * Sector: Software / HR-benefits tech. HQ: Brussels, Belgium.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `monizze`
 * (`https://monizze.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
