/**
 * Mindpeak — AI software for cancer diagnostics in pathology.
 *
 * Mindpeak develops AI-based software to support pathologists in analyzing
 * tissue samples for cancer diagnostics. Its tools aim to improve speed and
 * consistency of diagnostic assessment. The company is based in Germany.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (AI pathology / diagnostics). HQ: Hamburg, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `mindpeak`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mindpeak`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
