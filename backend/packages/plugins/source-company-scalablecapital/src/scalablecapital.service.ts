/**
 * Scalable Capital — German fintech operating a digital brokerage and wealth-management platform.
 *
 * Scalable Capital is a Munich-based financial technology company offering a
 * digital investment platform that combines a brokerage, ETF savings plans
 * and discretionary portfolio management. It serves retail investors across
 * several European markets and holds a securities-services licence.
 *
 * Sector: Financial technology (digital brokerage & wealth management). HQ: Munich, Bavaria, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `scalablegmbh`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/scalablegmbh`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
