/**
 * Sailor Health — Provides in-home and virtual clinical care programs for older adults.
 *
 * Sailor Health delivers clinical care services aimed at older adults and
 * Medicare populations. Its programs combine virtual and in-person clinical
 * engagement. The company hires clinical and operational staff across the
 * United States.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (senior / value-based care). HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sailorhealth`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sailorhealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
