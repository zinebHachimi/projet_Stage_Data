/**
 * Everlywell — Consumer digital health company offering at-home lab testing and telehealth services.
 *
 * Everlywell provides at-home laboratory test kits, digital results, and
 * connected telehealth care across consumer and enterprise channels. It
 * operates under the Everly Health umbrella spanning consumer, enterprise,
 * and diagnostics lines.
 *
 * Sector: Digital Health. HQ: Austin, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `everlywell`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/everlywell`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
