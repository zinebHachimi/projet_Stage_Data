/**
 * Saronic Technologies — Develops autonomous surface vessels and maritime autonomy systems for defense.
 *
 * Saronic Technologies designs and builds autonomous surface vessels and the
 * software that operates them, focused on maritime defense missions. The
 * company develops intelligent platforms intended to enhance naval and
 * maritime operations. It operates its own shipyard and production
 * engineering functions.
 *
 * Sector: Defense (Maritime Autonomy). HQ: Austin, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `saronic`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/saronic`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
