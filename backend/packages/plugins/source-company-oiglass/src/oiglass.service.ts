/**
 * O-I Glass — Manufacturer of glass containers for food and beverage brands worldwide.
 *
 * O-I Glass (Owens-Illinois) is a US-headquartered manufacturer of glass
 * packaging for the food and beverage industries. It produces glass bottles
 * and jars for beer, wine, spirits, and food brands globally. The company is
 * publicly traded and operates plants across multiple continents.
 *
 * Sector: Consumer goods packaging (glass). HQ: Perrysburg, Ohio, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `O-I`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/O-I`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
