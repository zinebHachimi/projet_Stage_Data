/**
 * DeleteMe — Privacy protection service that continuously removes exposed personal data from data brokers and the open web.
 *
 * DeleteMe is a privacy-protection service that continuously scans the open
 * web and data brokers to locate and remove individuals' personally
 * identifiable information, reducing exposure to identity theft, phishing,
 * doxxing, and related threats for both consumers and enterprises.
 *
 * Sector: Privacy (Personal Data Removal). HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `deleteme`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/deleteme`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
