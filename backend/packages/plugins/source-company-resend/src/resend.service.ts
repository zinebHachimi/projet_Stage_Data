/**
 * Resend — Email API platform for developers to send transactional email.
 *
 * Resend provides an email API designed for developers to build, test, and
 * send transactional and marketing emails. It focuses on developer
 * experience and deliverability for programmatic email sending.
 *
 * Sector: Developer infrastructure / Email API. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `resend`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/resend`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
