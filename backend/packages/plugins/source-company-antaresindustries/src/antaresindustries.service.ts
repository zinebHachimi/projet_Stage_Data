/**
 * Antares Industries — Develops transportable nuclear microreactors for defense, space, and terrestrial power.
 *
 * Antares Industries develops compact, transportable nuclear fission
 * microreactors for strategic energy applications on land, at sea, and in
 * space. Its R1 microreactor uses TRISO fuel and targets outputs between 100
 * kilowatts and 1 megawatt. The company has worked with the US Air Force, US
 * Space Force, NASA, and the Defense Innovation Unit.
 *
 * Sector: Nuclear (Defense & Space Power). HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `8fleet-inc`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/8fleet-inc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
