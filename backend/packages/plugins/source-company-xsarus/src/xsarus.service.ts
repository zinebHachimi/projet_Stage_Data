/**
 * XSARUS — Digital-commerce agency implementing and optimising e-commerce platforms (Adobe Commerce/Magento, Shopware) and PIM systems.
 *
 * XSARUS is a Dutch digital-commerce agency (founded 2000, ~95 staff) that
 * builds and optimises e-commerce platforms on Adobe Commerce/Magento and
 * Shopware plus PIM systems such as Akeneo and Inriver, serving retail
 * clients including Dille & Kamille and The Sting. The Recruitee board
 * xsarus.recruitee.com returned 5 live offers (PHP development and
 * e-commerce/PIM implementation consultants).
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce implementation agency / retail-tech services. HQ: Middelharnis, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `xsarus`
 * (`https://xsarus.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
