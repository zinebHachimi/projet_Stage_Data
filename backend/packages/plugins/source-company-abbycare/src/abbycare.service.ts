/**
 * Abby Care — Provides care and support for families of children with complex medical needs.
 *
 * Abby Care builds care programs for families caring for children with
 * disabilities and complex medical needs, including support for family
 * caregivers. It combines technology with clinical and administrative
 * services. The company operates within Medicaid home-care programs.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (pediatric / home care). HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `abby-care`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/abby-care`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
