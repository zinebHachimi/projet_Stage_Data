/**
 * Skydio — Builds autonomous flight drones for enterprise, public safety, and defense.
 *
 * Skydio designs and manufactures autonomous drones and the AI-based flight
 * software that powers them, serving enterprise, public safety, and defense
 * customers. The company builds both the hardware and autonomy stack. It is
 * headquartered in San Mateo, California.
 *
 * Sector: Autonomy / Drones. HQ: San Mateo, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `skydio`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/skydio`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
