/**
 * Scalian — Engineering consulting firm serving aerospace, defense, rail, and energy sectors.
 *
 * Scalian is a multinational engineering consulting firm specialized in
 * digital systems and industrial performance. It serves technological
 * sectors including aerospace, defense, rail, and energy, providing
 * engineering roles such as FPGA and systems engineering. The firm operates
 * across multiple countries.
 *
 * Sector: Aerospace & defense engineering services. HQ: Labege, Occitanie, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Scalian`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Scalian`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
