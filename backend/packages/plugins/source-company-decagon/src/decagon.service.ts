/**
 * Decagon — AI agents for customer support automation.
 *
 * Decagon builds AI customer-support agents that resolve customer inquiries
 * across channels for enterprises. Its platform integrates with existing
 * support systems.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / customer support. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `decagon`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/decagon`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
