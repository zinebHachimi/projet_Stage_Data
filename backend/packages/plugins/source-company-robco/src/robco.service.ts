/**
 * RobCo — Builds modular industrial robotic systems combined with physical AI software.
 *
 * RobCo develops modular industrial robotic systems paired with software to
 * automate manufacturing processes. The company combines reconfigurable
 * hardware modules with physical AI. It is headquartered in Munich, Germany,
 * with locations in San Francisco and Austin.
 *
 * Sector: Industrial automation / Robotics. HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `robco`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/robco`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
