/**
 * Hive Health — Health insurance and benefits platform for small and medium businesses.
 *
 * Hive Health provides health insurance and benefits plans aimed at small
 * and medium-sized businesses, with operations in the Philippines. It
 * combines insurance products with a technology platform for members and
 * employers. The company offers access to a provider network and telehealth.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (health insurance). HQ: Philippines / San Francisco, CA, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `hivehealth`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/hivehealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
