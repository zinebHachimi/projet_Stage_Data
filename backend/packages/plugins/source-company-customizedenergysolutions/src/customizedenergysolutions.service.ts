/**
 * Customized Energy Solutions — Provider of market intelligence and operational support services for electricity and natural gas markets.
 *
 * Customized Energy Solutions provides market intelligence, regulatory
 * support and operational services in the wholesale and retail electricity
 * and natural gas markets. It acts as a third-party asset manager for
 * renewable and conventional generation resources across North American
 * ISOs.
 *
 * Sector: Energy Services. HQ: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CustomizedEnergySolutions`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CustomizedEnergySolutions`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
