/**
 * TRM Labs — Blockchain intelligence platform for detecting and investigating crypto-related crime.
 *
 * TRM Labs provides blockchain analytics and intelligence solutions that
 * help financial institutions and public agencies detect, investigate, and
 * disrupt crypto-related financial crime. Its platform supports threat
 * intelligence and transaction risk analysis.
 *
 * Sector: Blockchain intelligence / risk. HQ: San Francisco, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `trm-labs`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/trm-labs`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
