/**
 * Northwestern Medicine — Academic health system affiliated with Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
 *
 * Northwestern Medicine is an integrated academic health system in the
 * Chicago area, comprising hospitals, outpatient facilities, and physician
 * groups. It is affiliated with Northwestern University Feinberg School of
 * Medicine. The system delivers patient care, medical education, and
 * research.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Chicago, Illinois, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `northwesternmedicine`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/northwesternmedicine`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
