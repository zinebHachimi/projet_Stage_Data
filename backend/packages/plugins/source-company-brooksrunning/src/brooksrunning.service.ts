/**
 * Brooks Running — Running footwear and apparel brand selling through retail and e-commerce.
 *
 * Brooks Running designs and sells running footwear, apparel, and
 * accessories. It operates internationally with distribution and design
 * functions spanning the US, Europe, and China, selling through wholesale,
 * retail, and online channels.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / Apparel e-commerce. HQ: Seattle, Washington, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `brooksrunning`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/brooksrunning`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
