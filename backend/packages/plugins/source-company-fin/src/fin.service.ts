/**
 * Fin — A stablecoin-powered payments platform for high-value, global, instant money movement.
 *
 * Fin is a payments platform built for high-value, global, and instant
 * transactions, using stablecoins to move funds between users, into bank
 * accounts, and across crypto rails. It is a Series A-stage company.
 * Investors include Sequoia and Circle.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Stablecoin payments. HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `fin`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/fin`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
