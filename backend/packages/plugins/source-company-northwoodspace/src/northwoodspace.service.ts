/**
 * Northwood Space — Builds software-defined phased-array antennas for satellite ground stations.
 *
 * Northwood Space produces phased-array antenna hardware and integrated
 * software to enable communication with satellites across multiple orbits.
 * Its Portal system is designed for mass manufacturing and aims to simplify
 * ground station deployment. The company was founded in 2022 and operates a
 * facility in Torrance, California.
 *
 * Sector: Space (Ground Infrastructure). HQ: Torrance, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `northwoodspace`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/northwoodspace`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
