/**
 * Prophet Security — AI-driven platform that automates security operations and alert investigation.
 *
 * Prophet Security builds a platform that automates complex security
 * operations tasks such as investigating and triaging security alerts. It is
 * aimed at helping security teams respond faster to potential threats.
 *
 * Sector: Security Operations. HQ: Palo Alto, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `prophet-security`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/prophet-security`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
