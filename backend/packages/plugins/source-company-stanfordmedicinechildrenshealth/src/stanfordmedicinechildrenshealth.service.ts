/**
 * Stanford Medicine Children\'s Health — Pediatric and obstetric academic health care system affiliated with Stanford Medicine.
 *
 * Stanford Medicine Children's Health is a pediatric and obstetric health
 * care system centered on Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford. It is
 * affiliated with Stanford University School of Medicine and provides
 * specialized care for children and expectant mothers.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Pediatric Hospital. HQ: Palo Alto, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `StanfordMedicineChildrensHealth`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/StanfordMedicineChildrensHealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
