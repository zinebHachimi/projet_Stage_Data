/**
 * Qualified Health — Builds a governed generative AI platform for healthcare organizations.
 *
 * Qualified Health is a public benefit corporation building a generative AI
 * platform designed for healthcare systems, with an emphasis on governance
 * and safe deployment. It works with health systems to integrate AI into
 * clinical and operational workflows. The company is structured as a PBC.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (healthcare AI). HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `qualified-health-pbc`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/qualified-health-pbc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
