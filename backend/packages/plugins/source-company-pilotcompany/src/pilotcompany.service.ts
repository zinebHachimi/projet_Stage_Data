/**
 * Pilot Company — North American operator of travel centers and truck stops serving professional drivers and travelers.
 *
 * Pilot Company operates a large network of travel centers and truck stops
 * across North America under the Pilot and Flying J brands. It provides
 * fuel, food, and services to professional drivers and travelers, and runs
 * energy and logistics operations. Headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee.
 *
 * Sector: Transportation & Travel Services. HQ: Knoxville, Tennessee, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `PilotCompany`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/PilotCompany`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
