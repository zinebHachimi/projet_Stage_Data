/**
 * UltraViolet Cyber — Platform-enabled unified security operations company providing managed detection, response, and offensive security services.
 *
 * UltraViolet Cyber is a security operations company that combines managed
 * detection and response, threat intelligence, detection engineering, and
 * offensive security (red teaming, penetration testing) on a unified
 * platform. It is built and run by security practitioners serving enterprise
 * and government clients.
 *
 * Sector: Cybersecurity (Managed Security / Security Operations). HQ: McLean, Virginia, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `uvcyber`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/uvcyber`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
