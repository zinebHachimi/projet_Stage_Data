/**
 * Mujin — Industrial automation company building robot-control technology for logistics and manufacturing.
 *
 * Mujin develops proprietary robot-control technology and delivers full
 * automation solutions for logistics and manufacturing. It hires engineering
 * roles including DevOps, backend, and physical-system engineers, primarily
 * in Japan.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / industrial automation. HQ: Tokyo, Japan.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `mujininc`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/mujininc`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
