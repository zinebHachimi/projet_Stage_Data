/**
 * Base Power Company — Deploys a network of distributed home batteries to strengthen the electric grid and provide backup power.
 *
 * Base Power is an energy company that installs distributed battery systems
 * in homes and connects them into a network that supports the electric grid.
 * It manufactures its own battery hardware and pairs it with a retail
 * electricity offering. The company operates in Texas and is expanding to
 * additional markets.
 *
 * Sector: Grid / energy storage. HQ: Austin, Texas, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `base-power`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/base-power`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
