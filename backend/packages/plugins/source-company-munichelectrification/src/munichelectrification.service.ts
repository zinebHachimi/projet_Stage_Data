/**
 * Munich Electrification — Develops battery management systems and power electronics for electric vehicles and energy storage.
 *
 * Munich Electrification develops battery management systems and power
 * electronics for automotive, commercial vehicle, and energy storage
 * applications. Its products support the electrification of transportation
 * and stationary storage. The company is headquartered in the Munich area of
 * Germany.
 *
 * Sector: Battery / power electronics. HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `munich-electrification`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/munich-electrification`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
