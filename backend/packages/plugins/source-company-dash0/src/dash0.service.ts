/**
 * Dash0 — OpenTelemetry-native observability and monitoring platform.
 *
 * Dash0 builds an OpenTelemetry-native observability platform focused on
 * making observability easier to install, integrate, and manage. The company
 * is in a growth phase following a Series B funding round and hires across
 * Engineering, Sales, and Marketing in EMEA and the US.
 *
 * Sector: Observability. HQ: Remote (EMEA-based).
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `dash0`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/dash0`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
