/**
 * Egis Group — International consulting, construction engineering, and operating firm active in infrastructure and mobility.
 *
 * Egis is an international group operating in architecture, consulting,
 * construction engineering, and mobility services. It designs and manages
 * infrastructure and building projects, and operates transport and other
 * facilities. The company works across roughly 100 countries.
 *
 * Sector: Construction Engineering & Infrastructure. HQ: Guyancourt, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `EgisGroup`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/EgisGroup`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
