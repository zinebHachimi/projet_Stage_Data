/**
 * Assent — Supply chain sustainability management software provider.
 *
 * Assent provides a software platform for supply chain sustainability and
 * regulatory compliance management, focused on complex manufacturers. Its
 * tools help companies track product compliance, ESG, and trade
 * requirements. It serves industrial and manufacturing enterprises.
 *
 * Sector: Enterprise SaaS (supply chain sustainability). HQ: Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Assent`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Assent`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
