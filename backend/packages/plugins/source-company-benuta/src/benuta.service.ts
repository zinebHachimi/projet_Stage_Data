/**
 * benuta — E-commerce retailer of rugs and home textiles selling across Europe via its own online shops.
 *
 * benuta GmbH is a German e-commerce company selling rugs and home textiles
 * online across multiple European countries, with teams in the Bonn/Cologne
 * region. Its Recruitee board (benutagmbh.recruitee.com) returned a JSON
 * offers array including roles such as 'Finanzbuchhalter / Accountant', a
 * working-student position in influencer marketing, and 'Facility Manager /
 * Leiter Immobilien & Gebäudemanagement'.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce (rugs & home textiles). HQ: Bonn, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `benutagmbh`
 * (`https://benutagmbh.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
