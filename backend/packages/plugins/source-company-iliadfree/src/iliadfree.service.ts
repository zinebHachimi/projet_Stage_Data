/**
 * Iliad / Free — French telecommunications operator providing mobile and fixed connectivity.
 *
 * Iliad, through its Free brand, is a French telecommunications operator
 * offering mobile and fixed broadband services, along with related IT, cloud
 * and data-center activities. It hires engineering, technical, marketing and
 * business roles primarily in France.
 *
 * Sector: Telecommunications. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Iliad-Free`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Iliad-Free`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
