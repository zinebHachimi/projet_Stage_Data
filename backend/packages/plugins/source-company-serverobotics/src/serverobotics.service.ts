/**
 * Serve Robotics — Builds autonomous sidewalk delivery robots for last-mile logistics.
 *
 * Serve Robotics designs and operates autonomous sidewalk delivery robots
 * for last-mile delivery in cities. The company builds the robots' hardware
 * and autonomy stack and operates a fleet for food and goods delivery. It is
 * publicly traded and headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Autonomous delivery. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `serverobotics`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/serverobotics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
