/**
 * FieldBuddy — Field service management software for planning and executing on-site service work.
 *
 * FieldBuddy is a Dutch software company providing a field service
 * management platform used to plan, dispatch, and execute on-site service
 * and maintenance work. It operates from Amsterdam with development in
 * Etten-Leur, Noord-Brabant.
 *
 * Sector: Field service management SaaS. HQ: Amsterdam / Etten-Leur, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `fieldbuddy`
 * (`https://fieldbuddy.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
