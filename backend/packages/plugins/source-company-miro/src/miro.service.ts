/**
 * Miro — Visual collaboration and online whiteboard platform for distributed teams.
 *
 * Miro is a visual collaboration platform that provides an online whiteboard
 * for brainstorming, diagramming, workshops, and project planning. Teams use
 * it for real-time and asynchronous collaboration across distributed
 * workforces. It integrates with common productivity and developer tools.
 *
 * Sector: Productivity & collaboration software. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `miro`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/miro`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
