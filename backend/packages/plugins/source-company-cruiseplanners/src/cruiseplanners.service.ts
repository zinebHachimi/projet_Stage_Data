/**
 * Cruise Planners — US travel agency franchise network specializing in cruises and vacation planning.
 *
 * Cruise Planners is a US-based travel agency franchise network
 * headquartered in Coral Springs, Florida. It supports a network of
 * independent travel advisors selling cruises, tours, and vacation packages,
 * and recruits for corporate and support roles.
 *
 * Sector: Travel. HQ: Coral Springs, Florida, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `CruisePlanners`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CruisePlanners`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
