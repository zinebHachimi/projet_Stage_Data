/**
 * AFRY — European engineering and consulting firm with a large energy and renewables practice.
 *
 * AFRY is a Swedish-Finnish engineering, design and advisory company serving
 * the energy, industry and infrastructure sectors. Its energy division works
 * on hydropower, wind, solar PV, grid/HVDC, nuclear and energy transition
 * projects internationally.
 *
 * Sector: Energy Engineering & Consulting. HQ: Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AFRY`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AFRY`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
