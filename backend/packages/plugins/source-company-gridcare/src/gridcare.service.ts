/**
 * GridCARE — Provides software and analysis to speed grid interconnection for new large electricity loads.
 *
 * GridCARE develops software and data analysis to identify available grid
 * capacity and accelerate interconnection for large electricity loads such
 * as data centers. It works with utilities and developers on interconnection
 * studies and utility partnerships. The company is based in Redwood City,
 * California.
 *
 * Sector: Grid / interconnection. HQ: Redwood City, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `gridcare`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/gridcare`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
