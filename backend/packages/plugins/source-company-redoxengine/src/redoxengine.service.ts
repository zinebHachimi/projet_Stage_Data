/**
 * Redox — Healthcare data interoperability platform connecting software to health systems.
 *
 * Redox provides an interoperability platform and API that connects digital
 * health applications with electronic health record systems and healthcare
 * organizations. It hires remotely across the United States.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / Healthcare Technology. HQ: Madison, Wisconsin, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `redoxengine`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/redoxengine`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
