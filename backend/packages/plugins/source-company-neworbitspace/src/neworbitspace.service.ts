/**
 * NewOrbit Space — Develops spacecraft and flight software for space missions.
 *
 * NewOrbit Space is a UK-based space company developing spacecraft and
 * associated flight software. Its work spans spacecraft engineering and
 * flight software teams. The company is based in the Reading area near
 * London.
 *
 * Sector: Space. HQ: Reading, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `neworbit`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/neworbit`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
