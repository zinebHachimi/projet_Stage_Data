/**
 * Smiths Group — Diversified industrial technology company engineering products for energy, safety, and general industrial markets.
 *
 * Smiths Group plc is a British multinational engineering company. It
 * designs and manufactures products across divisions including John Crane
 * (mechanical seals and flow control), Smiths Detection, Flex-Tek, and
 * Smiths Interconnect, serving energy, industrial, and security markets.
 *
 * Sector: Industrial technology / Engineering. HQ: London, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `SmithsGroup2`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/SmithsGroup2`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
