/**
 * Halton Healthcare — Community hospital system serving the Halton region of Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Halton Healthcare operates community hospitals in Oakville, Milton, and
 * Georgetown, Ontario, providing acute care, emergency, maternal-child, and
 * specialty services to the Halton region. It is a public hospital
 * organization.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Oakville, Ontario, Canada.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `HaltonHealthcare1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/HaltonHealthcare1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
