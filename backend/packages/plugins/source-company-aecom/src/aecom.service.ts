/**
 * AECOM — Global infrastructure consulting firm with an extensive renewable energy and power practice.
 *
 * AECOM is a global infrastructure consulting firm providing engineering and
 * advisory services. Its energy work spans solar PV, onshore and offshore
 * wind, hydropower, microgrids, battery storage and transmission and
 * distribution infrastructure.
 *
 * Sector: Energy & Infrastructure Engineering. HQ: Dallas, Texas, United States.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `AECOM2`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/AECOM2`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
