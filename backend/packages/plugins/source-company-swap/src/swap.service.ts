/**
 * Swap — Commerce operations platform centralizing cross-border, tax, returns, and fulfillment for e-commerce brands.
 *
 * Swap is a commerce infrastructure platform that centralizes global
 * e-commerce operations for brands, including cross-border logistics, tax,
 * returns, and demand planning. It aims to unify back-office commerce
 * workflows into a single platform. The company hosts its careers page on
 * Ashby.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce operations infrastructure. HQ: London, England, United Kingdom.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `swap`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/swap`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
