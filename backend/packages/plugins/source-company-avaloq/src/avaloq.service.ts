/**
 * Avaloq — Provider of banking and wealth management software and services for financial institutions.
 *
 * Avaloq develops core banking and wealth management technology used by
 * private banks, wealth managers, and other financial institutions. It
 * offers both software licensing and business process outsourcing. Avaloq is
 * part of NEC Corporation.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech / wealth management technology. HQ: Zurich, Switzerland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Avaloq1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Avaloq1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
