/**
 * WindRanger Labs — Web3 development organization building blockchain ecosystem products.
 *
 * WindRanger Labs is a Web3 development organization that builds products
 * and contributes to blockchain ecosystems. It works across business
 * development and engineering for onchain projects. The team operates in the
 * decentralized technology space.
 *
 * Sector: Web3 / blockchain development. HQ: Remote.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `windranger`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/windranger`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
