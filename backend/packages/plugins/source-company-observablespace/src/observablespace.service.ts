/**
 * Observable Space — Builds telescopes, lasercom ground stations, and optical sensors for space domain awareness.
 *
 * Observable Space develops software-defined telescopes and vertically
 * integrated optical hardware and software for space observation. Its
 * product areas include laser communications ground stations, ground-based
 * optical space domain awareness sensing, and in-space optical payloads. The
 * company was formed from the merger of OurSky and PlaneWave Instruments and
 * has a US Space Force IDIQ contract.
 *
 * Sector: Space (Optics & Domain Awareness). HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `observable-space`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/observable-space`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
