/**
 * Dealroom.co — Data platform providing intelligence on startups, scaleups, investors, and tech ecosystems.
 *
 * Dealroom.co is an Amsterdam-based B2B data platform providing intelligence
 * on startups, scaleups, investors, and innovation ecosystems, used by
 * governments, corporates, and investors. It hires business development and
 * client relationship roles across EMEA and North America.
 *
 * Sector: Data / market intelligence SaaS. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `dealroomco`
 * (`https://dealroomco.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
