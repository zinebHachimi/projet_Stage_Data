/**
 * dLocal — Cross-border payments platform for collecting and disbursing money in emerging markets.
 *
 * dLocal provides a payments platform that enables global merchants to
 * collect payments and make payouts across emerging markets, operating as
 * both a payments processor and merchant of record in 40 countries.
 *
 * Sector: Payments. HQ: Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `dlocal`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/dlocal`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
