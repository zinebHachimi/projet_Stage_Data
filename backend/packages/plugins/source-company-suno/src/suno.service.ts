/**
 * Suno — AI music generation platform that creates songs from text prompts.
 *
 * Suno builds generative AI models for music creation, allowing users to
 * produce songs including vocals and instrumentation from text prompts. It
 * is available as a web and mobile application.
 *
 * Sector: Applied AI / music. HQ: Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `suno`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/suno`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
