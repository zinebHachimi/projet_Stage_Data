/**
 * Aspora — A cross-border financial platform for the non-resident Indian diaspora.
 *
 * Aspora, founded in 2022, builds a cross-border financial operating system
 * serving the non-resident Indian (NRI) diaspora, offering money transfers
 * and bill payments to India through regulated entities and partnerships. It
 * is backed by investors including Sequoia Capital, Greylock, Hummingbird, Y
 * Combinator, and Global Founders Capital.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Remittance & cross-border banking. HQ: USA / India.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `aspora`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/aspora`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
