/**
 * JG Wentworth Home Lending — US mortgage lender originating conventional, VA, and FHA home loans.
 *
 * JG Wentworth Home Lending is a US mortgage lending business that
 * originates conventional, VA, and FHA loans. It is part of The J.G.
 * Wentworth Company and is licensed to operate across many US states.
 *
 * Sector: Financial services / mortgage lending. HQ: Woodbridge, Virginia, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `JGWentworthHomeLendingLLC`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/JGWentworthHomeLendingLLC`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
