/**
 * Included Health — Virtual-first healthcare navigation and integrated care platform for employers and health plans.
 *
 * Included Health provides healthcare navigation, virtual primary and
 * behavioral care, and specialty care guidance to members through employer
 * and health-plan partnerships. It combines care coordination with
 * telehealth clinical services.
 *
 * Sector: Digital Health. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `includedhealth`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/includedhealth`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
