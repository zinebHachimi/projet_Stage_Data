/**
 * Pickle Robot Company — Autonomous robots that unload trucks and containers in warehouses and distribution centers.
 *
 * Pickle Robot builds physical AI systems that automate truck and container
 * unloading in logistics operations. Its robots use perception and autonomy
 * software to handle mixed-case freight.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics. HQ: Charlestown, Massachusetts, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `picklerobot`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/picklerobot`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
