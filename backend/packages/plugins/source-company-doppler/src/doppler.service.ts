/**
 * Doppler — Cloud-based secrets management platform for development teams.
 *
 * Doppler provides a developer-first secrets management platform that
 * centralizes and controls application secrets across environments. It helps
 * teams orchestrate and govern configuration and credentials at scale.
 *
 * Sector: Developer infrastructure / Secrets management. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `doppler`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/doppler`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
