/**
 * Zapier — No-code automation platform connecting thousands of web apps.
 *
 * Zapier is a workflow-automation platform that lets users connect web
 * applications and automate tasks without code through automated workflows
 * called Zaps. It integrates with thousands of apps. The company operates as
 * a fully remote organization.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / workflow automation. HQ: Remote (Sunnyvale, California, USA).
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `zapier`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/zapier`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
