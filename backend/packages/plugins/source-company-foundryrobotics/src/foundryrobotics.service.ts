/**
 * Foundry Robotics — Builds AI-powered robotic manufacturing systems for robotics and hardware production.
 *
 * Foundry Robotics builds AI-powered manufacturing systems, robots, factory
 * software, and data infrastructure aimed at contract manufacturing of
 * robotics and hardware. The company positions itself as an AI-first,
 * assembly-focused, dual-use manufacturer. Roles are based on-site in San
 * Francisco, California.
 *
 * Sector: Robotics / Manufacturing automation. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `foundry-robotics`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/foundry-robotics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
