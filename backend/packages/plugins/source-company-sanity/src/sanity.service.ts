/**
 * Sanity — Headless content platform and content operating system for developers.
 *
 * Sanity provides a headless content management platform, described as a
 * content operating system, that treats content as structured data
 * accessible via APIs. It includes a customizable editing environment called
 * Sanity Studio. The company has operations in San Francisco and Oslo.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / developer tools. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA / Oslo, Norway.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `sanity`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sanity`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
