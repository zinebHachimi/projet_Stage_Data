/**
 * Trust Wallet — Non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet supporting multiple blockchains and assets.
 *
 * Trust Wallet is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet used to store and
 * manage digital assets. It supports many assets across a range of
 * blockchains. The product targets self-custody for retail crypto users.
 *
 * Sector: Crypto wallet. HQ: Singapore.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `trust-wallet`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/trust-wallet`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
