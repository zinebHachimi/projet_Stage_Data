/**
 * Above Lending — Consumer lending company offering personal loans and debt-consolidation products.
 *
 * Above Lending is a consumer financial services company providing personal
 * loan and debt-consolidation products, with a focus on transparent terms
 * and personalized support across the client lifecycle.
 *
 * Sector: Consumer Lending. HQ: Chicago, Illinois, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `abovelending`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/abovelending`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
