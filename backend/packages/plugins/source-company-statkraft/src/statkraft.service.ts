/**
 * Statkraft — Norwegian state-owned company and Europe\'s largest generator of renewable energy from hydropower, wind and solar.
 *
 * Statkraft is a Norwegian state-owned enterprise and one of Europe's
 * largest producers of renewable energy. It generates power from hydropower,
 * onshore and offshore wind, and solar, and is active in energy market
 * operations and trading across Europe and beyond.
 *
 * Sector: Renewable Energy. HQ: Oslo, Oslo, Norway.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `statkraft1`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/statkraft1`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
