/**
 * Believe — Digital music distribution and artist services company.
 *
 * Believe is a digital music company providing distribution, marketing and
 * label services for artists and independent labels across digital
 * platforms. It hires across label operations, technology, marketing and
 * corporate roles in many countries.
 *
 * Sector: Music & Media. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `believe`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/believe`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
