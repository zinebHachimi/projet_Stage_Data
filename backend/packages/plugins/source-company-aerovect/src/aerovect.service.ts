/**
 * AeroVect — Develops autonomous driving technology for airport ground support equipment.
 *
 * AeroVect builds autonomy technology for airport ground handling,
 * converting ground support equipment into autonomous vehicles for airlines
 * and ground service providers. The company develops the hardware
 * integration and autonomous driving platform for airside operations. It is
 * a venture-backed Series A company.
 *
 * Sector: Autonomy / Aviation ground handling. HQ: USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `aerovect`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/aerovect`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
