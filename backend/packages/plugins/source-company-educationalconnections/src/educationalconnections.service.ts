/**
 * Educational Connections — Academic tutoring and educational-support services provider.
 *
 * Educational Connections is a tutoring and academic-support company that
 * provides in-person and online tutoring, test preparation, and
 * executive-function coaching for students. It hires part-time tutors and
 * academic-support staff.
 *
 * Sector: Education (tutoring services). HQ: Vienna, Virginia, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `EducationalConnections`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/EducationalConnections`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
