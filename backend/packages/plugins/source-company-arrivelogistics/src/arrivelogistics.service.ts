/**
 * Arrive Logistics — Freight brokerage and transportation logistics provider.
 *
 * Arrive Logistics is a freight brokerage company providing truckload,
 * less-than-truckload and other transportation services connecting shippers
 * and carriers across North America.
 *
 * Sector: logistics. HQ: Austin, Texas, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `arrivelogistics`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/arrivelogistics`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
