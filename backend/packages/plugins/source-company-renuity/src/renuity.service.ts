/**
 * Renuity — Home improvement company operating a network of regional home renovation brands.
 *
 * Renuity is a home improvement company that brings together a network of
 * regional brands offering renovation services such as bath, kitchen, and
 * other home upgrades. It markets and sells home improvement products and
 * services to consumers. The company hosts its careers page on Ashby.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / home improvement. HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `renuity`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/renuity`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
