/**
 * Oso — Authorization-as-a-service platform for controlling access in applications.
 *
 * Oso provides authorization infrastructure that helps developers control
 * who has access to what within their applications. Its platform is used by
 * companies ranging from startups to large enterprises.
 *
 * Sector: Authorization. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `oso`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/oso`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
