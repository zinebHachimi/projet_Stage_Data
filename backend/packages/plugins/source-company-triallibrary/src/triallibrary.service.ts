/**
 * Trial Library — Platform expanding access to and diversity in oncology clinical trials.
 *
 * Trial Library operates a research platform aimed at improving access to
 * precision medicine and increasing diversity in oncology clinical trials by
 * connecting patients and providers to relevant studies.
 *
 * Sector: Health Tech / Clinical Research. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `triallibrary`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/triallibrary`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
