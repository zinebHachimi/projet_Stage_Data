/**
 * OP Labs — Builds the technology behind Optimism and the open-source OP Stack.
 *
 * OP Labs builds the technology behind Optimism, an Ethereum layer-2 scaling
 * ecosystem. Its open-source OP Stack lets developers launch onchain
 * networks. The team works on protocol engineering including proofs and
 * scaling.
 *
 * Sector: Ethereum layer-2 infrastructure. HQ: Remote.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `oplabs`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/oplabs`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
