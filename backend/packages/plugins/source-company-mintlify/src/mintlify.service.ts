/**
 * Mintlify — Platform for building and hosting developer and API documentation.
 *
 * Mintlify provides a platform for creating, hosting, and maintaining
 * developer and API documentation. It is used by software companies to
 * publish product and API docs.
 *
 * Sector: Developer tools / Documentation. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `mintlify`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/mintlify`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
