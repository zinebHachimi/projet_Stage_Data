/**
 * WATCHVICE (Leingang E-Commerce) — Luxury-watch e-commerce trading company selling and buying watches such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet online.
 *
 * Leingang E-Commerce GmbH, operating the WATCHVICE brand, is a German
 * e-commerce company trading luxury watches (including Rolex, Patek Philippe
 * and Audemars Piguet) online, paired with a large German-language
 * luxury-watch content channel. Its Recruitee board
 * (watchvice.recruitee.com) returned a JSON offers array with sales and
 * back-office roles based in Bietigheim-Bissingen.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce (luxury watches). HQ: Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `watchvice`
 * (`https://watchvice.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
