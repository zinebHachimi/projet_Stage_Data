/**
 * Reonic — Provides software for solar and heat pump installers to plan and manage residential energy projects.
 *
 * Reonic builds software used by installers of solar systems, battery
 * storage, and heat pumps to plan, quote, and manage residential
 * clean-energy installations. The platform is aimed at streamlining the
 * sales and installation workflow for energy tradespeople. The company is
 * based in Germany.
 *
 * Sector: Solar / clean energy software. HQ: Karlsruhe, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `reonic`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/reonic`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
