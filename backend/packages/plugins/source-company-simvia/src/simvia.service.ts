/**
 * Simvia — Compliance and certification management software for food and agriculture supply chains (formerly AgriPlace).
 *
 * Simvia (formerly AgriPlace) is an Amsterdam-based software company whose
 * platform manages compliance, certifications, and documentation across food
 * and agriculture supply chains. The agriplace.recruitee.com board now
 * redirects to simvia.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: Compliance / agri-food SaaS. HQ: Amsterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `simvia`
 * (`https://simvia.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
