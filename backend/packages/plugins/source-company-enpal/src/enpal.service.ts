/**
 * Enpal — Provides subscription-based solar panels, battery storage, heat pumps, and EV charging for homes.
 *
 * Enpal is a German clean-energy company that offers residential solar
 * systems, battery storage, heat pumps, and EV charging, often on a
 * subscription or leasing model. It also operates a virtual power plant that
 * aggregates distributed home energy assets. The company serves households
 * across Germany.
 *
 * Sector: Solar / clean energy. HQ: Berlin, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `enpal`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/enpal`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
