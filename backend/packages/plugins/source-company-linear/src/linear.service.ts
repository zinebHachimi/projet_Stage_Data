/**
 * Linear — Issue tracking and project management tool for software teams.
 *
 * Linear builds an issue tracking and software project management
 * application designed for engineering and product teams. The product
 * emphasizes speed and a keyboard-driven workflow.
 *
 * Sector: Developer tools / Project management. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `linear`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/linear`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
