/**
 * Proxima Fusion — Develops stellarator-based fusion power plants for clean energy generation.
 *
 * Proxima Fusion is a German fusion energy company developing stellarator
 * technology with the goal of building commercial fusion power plants. It
 * emerged from research associated with the Max Planck Institute for Plasma
 * Physics. The company is based in Munich.
 *
 * Sector: Fusion energy. HQ: Munich, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `proxima-fusion`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/proxima-fusion`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
