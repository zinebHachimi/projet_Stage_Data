/**
 * Qualifyze — Digital supply-chain compliance and auditing platform for life sciences.
 *
 * Qualifyze GmbH provides digital supply-chain compliance management for the
 * life-sciences industry, connecting manufacturers, suppliers, and a network
 * of auditors to track and manage quality and GxP compliance. It operates
 * from Frankfurt and Barcelona.
 *
 * Sector: Life-sciences compliance SaaS. HQ: Frankfurt, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `qualifyzegmbh`
 * (`https://qualifyzegmbh.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
