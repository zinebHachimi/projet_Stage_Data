/**
 * Dust — Platform for building and deploying AI agents connected to company data and tools.
 *
 * Dust provides a platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents
 * that connect to a company's knowledge, tools, and workflows in a shared
 * workspace. It is aimed at teams operationalizing AI across functions. The
 * company is based in Paris.
 *
 * Sector: B2B SaaS / AI collaboration software. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `dust`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/dust`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
