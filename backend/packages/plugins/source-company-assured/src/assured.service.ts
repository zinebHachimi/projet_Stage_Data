/**
 * Assured — AI platform for automating insurance claims processing.
 *
 * Assured builds AI software to automate insurance claims processing,
 * including in health and other insurance lines. Its platform aims to speed
 * up claims handling for insurers. The company hires across engineering and
 * operations.
 *
 * Sector: Healthtech (claims AI). HQ: United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `assured-health`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/assured-health`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
