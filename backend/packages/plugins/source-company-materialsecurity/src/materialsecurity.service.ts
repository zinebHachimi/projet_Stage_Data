/**
 * Material Security — Security platform protecting cloud email and productivity accounts.
 *
 * Material Security provides a platform that protects cloud email and
 * workspace environments against threats such as account takeover, phishing,
 * and data exposure. It focuses on securing Google Workspace and Microsoft
 * 365 accounts and their data.
 *
 * Sector: Email & Cloud Security. HQ: Redwood City, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `materialsecurity`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/materialsecurity`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
