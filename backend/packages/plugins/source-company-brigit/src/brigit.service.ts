/**
 * Brigit — A financial health app offering cash advances and budgeting tools.
 *
 * Brigit is a consumer financial health company that provides tools such as
 * cash advances, budgeting, and credit-building features aimed at helping
 * people manage day-to-day finances. It operates a mobile app for everyday
 * consumers.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Consumer financial health. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `brigit`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/brigit`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
