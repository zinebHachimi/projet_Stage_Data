/**
 * GE HealthCare — Medical technology company providing imaging, ultrasound, and patient care solutions.
 *
 * GE HealthCare is a medical technology company that develops imaging
 * systems, ultrasound, patient monitoring, and related diagnostic and care
 * solutions for hospitals and healthcare providers. It became an independent
 * public company after separating from General Electric in 2023.
 *
 * Sector: Medical Devices / Medical Technology. HQ: Chicago, Illinois, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `GEHealthcare2`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/GEHealthcare2`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
