/**
 * Nexthink — Digital employee experience management software provider.
 *
 * Nexthink provides a software platform for digital employee experience
 * management, giving IT teams visibility into endpoint performance and
 * employee sentiment. Its analytics and automation tools help improve
 * workplace technology experiences. It serves large enterprise IT
 * organizations.
 *
 * Sector: Enterprise SaaS (digital employee experience). HQ: Lausanne, Switzerland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Nexthink`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Nexthink`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
