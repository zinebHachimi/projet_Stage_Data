/**
 * KIPP — National non-profit network of tuition-free, open-enrollment public charter schools.
 *
 * KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) is a non-profit network of tuition-free,
 * open-enrollment public charter schools serving students across many U.S.
 * regions. It employs teachers, school leaders, and operational staff to run
 * K-12 college-preparatory schools in underserved communities.
 *
 * Sector: Education (K-12 public charter schools / non-profit). HQ: New York, New York, USA (national office).
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `KIPP`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/KIPP`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
