/**
 * Matera — SaaS platform for co-ownership and residential property management (self-managed syndic).
 *
 * Matera is a Paris-based SaaS company offering a platform for co-ownership
 * (copropriété) and residential property management, letting building owners
 * self-manage or use assisted syndic services. It operates in France and
 * Germany. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at matera.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: PropTech / SaaS. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `matera`
 * (`https://matera.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
