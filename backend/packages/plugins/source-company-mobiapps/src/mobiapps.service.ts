/**
 * Mobiapps — Digital services company specializing in mobile, web application development and QA/testing.
 *
 * Mobiapps is a French digital-services company delivering consulting and
 * technical implementation for mobile and web application development,
 * quality assurance and testing across native, cross-platform and
 * progressive-web-app technologies. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at
 * mobiapps.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: IT services / Software development. HQ: France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `mobiapps`
 * (`https://mobiapps.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
