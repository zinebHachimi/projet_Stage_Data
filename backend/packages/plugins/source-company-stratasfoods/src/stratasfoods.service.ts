/**
 * Stratas Foods — Manufacturer and distributor of edible oils, shortenings, and dressings.
 *
 * Stratas Foods is a US food manufacturer that produces and distributes
 * edible oils, shortenings, mayonnaise, dressings, and related products for
 * food service, retail, and food ingredient customers. It is a joint venture
 * headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, with production facilities across the
 * United States.
 *
 * Sector: Food Manufacturing (Oils & Fats). HQ: Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `StratasFoods`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/StratasFoods`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
