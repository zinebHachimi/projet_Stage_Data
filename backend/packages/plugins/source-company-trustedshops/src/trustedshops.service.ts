/**
 * Trusted Shops — E-commerce trust platform offering trustmarks, buyer protection, and reviews.
 *
 * Trusted Shops SE operates a SaaS platform for e-commerce that builds
 * digital trust through its Trustmark, buyer-protection services, and review
 * products, serving a large community of consumers and merchants.
 *
 * Sector: E-commerce SaaS. HQ: Cologne, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `trustedshops`
 * (`https://trustedshops.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
