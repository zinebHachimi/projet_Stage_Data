/**
 * Madhappy — Los Angeles-based apparel brand focused on optimism and mental health awareness.
 *
 * Madhappy is a Los Angeles-based clothing brand founded in 2017 that sells
 * apparel online and through retail and pop-up spaces. Its work incorporates
 * mental health awareness and community events.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / Apparel e-commerce. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `madhappy`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/madhappy`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
