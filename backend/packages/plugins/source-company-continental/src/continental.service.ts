/**
 * Continental — Automotive supplier and tire manufacturer producing tires, brake systems, and vehicle electronics.
 *
 * Continental AG is a German automotive parts manufacturing company. It
 * develops technologies and services for mobility, including tires, brake
 * systems, vehicle electronics, and industrial products. It supplies
 * automotive OEMs and operates plants globally.
 *
 * Sector: Automotive supplier / Tire manufacturing. HQ: Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `Continental`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Continental`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
