/**
 * GoodLeap — Point-of-sale financing platform for residential solar and sustainable home improvements.
 *
 * GoodLeap provides a point-of-sale financing and technology platform for
 * sustainable home improvements, including residential solar, batteries, and
 * energy-efficiency upgrades, connecting contractors, homeowners, and
 * capital markets.
 *
 * Sector: Lending / Fintech. HQ: Roseville, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `goodleap`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/goodleap`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
