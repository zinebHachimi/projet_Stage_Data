/**
 * Verifiable — AI, API, and software platform for healthcare provider credentialing and network monitoring.
 *
 * Verifiable provides an API-driven platform for healthcare provider
 * credentialing and network monitoring, helping healthcare organizations
 * automate compliance operations at enterprise scale. Roles are largely
 * remote.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare API / SaaS platform. HQ: United States (remote-first).
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `verifiable`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/verifiable`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
