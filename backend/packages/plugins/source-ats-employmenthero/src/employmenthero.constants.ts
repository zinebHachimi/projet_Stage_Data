/**
 * Constants for the Employment Hero careers platform.
 *
 * Employment Hero (employmenthero.com — an AU / NZ / SEA / UK all-in-one HR, payroll &
 * recruitment platform; its recruitment arm powers branded candidate-facing career pages and
 * embeddable job widgets for a large multi-tenant base) addresses each tenant's public,
 * unauthenticated job board by a per-tenant **friendly id** (organisation slug) on the shared
 * jobs host:
 *
 *   https://jobs.employmenthero.com/organisations/{slug}        (branded employer job board)
 *   https://employmenthero.com/jobs/organisations/{slug}/       (the same board, canonical host)
 *   https://employmenthero.com/jobs/position/{friendlyId}/      (per-role public detail / apply page)
 *
 * The `jobs.employmenthero.com/organisations/{slug}` board 307-redirects to the canonical
 * `employmenthero.com/jobs/organisations/{slug}/` page, a server-rendered listing whose own
 * client reads a **single public, anonymous JSON API** baked into the page as `jobsBaseUrl`
 * (no bearer token — the board fetches it for anonymous visitors):
 *
 *   Career-page jobs feed (host `services.employmenthero.com`):
 *     GET https://services.employmenthero.com/ats/api/v1/career_page/organisations/{slug}/jobs
 *         ?page_index={n}&item_per_page={size}
 *       → { data: { items: [ { …role… } ], page_index, item_per_page, total_pages, total_items } }
 *
 *   Each `data.items[]` role carries a stable string `id` (UUID — the ATS id), a `title`,
 *   a `friendly_id` (the `{slug}-{title}-{shortid}` token that forms the public
 *   `/jobs/position/{friendlyId}/` detail URL), an HTML `description`, a `company_overview`,
 *   `country_code` (ISO-3166 alpha-2), `vendor_location_name` (free-text location line),
 *   `remote` (bool) + `workplace_type` (`remote_anywhere` / `hybrid` / on-site) +
 *   `remote_setting` (`{ anywhere, country_code, … }`), `team_name` (≈ department),
 *   `employment_type_name` (e.g. `Full-time`), `employment_term_name` (e.g. `Permanent`),
 *   `experience_level_name`, `organisation_name`, `organisation_friendly_id`,
 *   `organisation_logo`, salary fields, and `created_at` (ISO-8601 timestamp). The envelope
 *   carries first-class pagination meta (`page_index`, `total_pages`, `total_items`), so the
 *   adapter walks `page_index` until it reaches `total_pages` (bounded by a page cap), rather
 *   than depending on a client-rendered DOM, a headless browser, or any authenticated
 *   Employment Hero API.
 *
 * The adapter resolves the tenant slug from `companySlug` or from a `companyUrl` on a
 * `jobs.employmenthero.com` / `employmenthero.com` host (an `/organisations/{slug}` path),
 * fetches the career-page jobs feed, drains it page by page, and maps each role. An unknown
 * slug (the feed answers HTTP 404 `organisation_not_found`), a tenant with no roles, or an
 * empty board degrades naturally to an empty result. A fetch error, an HTTP 4xx/5xx, a DNS
 * failure, or a malformed body degrades to an empty / partial result rather than throwing, so
 * a single bad tenant never nukes a batch run.
 *
 * Surface confidence (researched + verified live 2026-06-04, no authentication):
 *  - Confirmed the platform + slug addressing
 *    (`jobs.employmenthero.com/organisations/{slug}` 307→
 *    `employmenthero.com/jobs/organisations/{slug}/`) and the API base host baked into the
 *    board page as `jobsBaseUrl`
 *    (`services.employmenthero.com/ats/api/v1/career_page/organisations/{slug}/jobs`).
 *  - Confirmed
 *    `GET https://services.employmenthero.com/ats/api/v1/career_page/organisations/employmenthero/jobs`
 *    returns `{ data: { items: [ { id: "ed3c8943-…", title: "HR Advisor",
 *    friendly_id: "employment-hero-hr-advisor-hbg0o", country_code: "GB",
 *    vendor_location_name: "Greater London, SouthEast E1", remote: true,
 *    workplace_type: "remote_anywhere", team_name: "HR Advisory",
 *    employment_type_name: "Full-time", created_at: "2026-06-02T12:51:22Z",
 *    description: "<p>…</p>", … } ], page_index: 1, item_per_page: 10,
 *    total_pages: 9, total_items: 90 } }` anonymously.
 *  - Confirmed `?page_index=2&item_per_page=5` returns the next 5 roles with
 *    `total_pages: 18` (page-index pagination), and that an unknown slug returns HTTP 404
 *    `{ error: { errors: [ { reason: "organisation_not_found" } ] } }`. verified=true.
