/**
 * Dave — A consumer banking app offering banking and short-term cash advance products.
 *
 * Dave is a consumer fintech offering banking services and short-term cash
 * advance products designed for accessibility and affordability. It operates
 * a mobile banking app for everyday consumers.
 *
 * Sector: Fintech - Neobanking & consumer credit. HQ: Los Angeles, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `dave`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/dave`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
