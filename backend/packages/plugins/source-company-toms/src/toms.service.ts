/**
 * TOMS — Footwear and accessories brand known for its giving-based business model.
 *
 * TOMS is a footwear, eyewear, and accessories brand that sells
 * direct-to-consumer, online through marketplaces, and via wholesale and
 * retail channels. The company is known for its history of tying charitable
 * giving to product sales. It is based in Los Angeles.
 *
 * Sector: Retail / consumer footwear brand. HQ: Los Angeles, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `toms`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/toms`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
