/**
 * Render — Unified cloud platform for building, deploying, and scaling applications.
 *
 * Render provides a unified cloud platform for deploying and managing web
 * applications, APIs, databases, and background services. It offers
 * computing, networking, and storage with Git-based deploys.
 *
 * Sector: Cloud platform / Infrastructure. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `render`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/render`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
