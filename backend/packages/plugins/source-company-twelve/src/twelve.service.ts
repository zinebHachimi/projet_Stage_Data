/**
 * Twelve — Uses carbon transformation technology to turn CO2 into fuels, chemicals, and materials.
 *
 * Twelve develops carbon transformation technology that converts captured
 * carbon dioxide into chemicals, materials, and fuels using
 * electrochemistry. One focus area is producing sustainable aviation fuel
 * from CO2. The company is based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 *
 * Sector: Carbon transformation. HQ: Berkeley, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `twelve`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/twelve`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
