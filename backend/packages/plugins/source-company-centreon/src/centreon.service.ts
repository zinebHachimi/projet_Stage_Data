/**
 * Centreon — IT infrastructure monitoring and observability software vendor.
 *
 * Centreon is a French software editor providing IT infrastructure
 * monitoring and observability solutions, with a platform of connectors and
 * tools for supervising software and hardware systems. It is positioned as a
 * European leader in IT monitoring. Careers are hosted on Recruitee at
 * centreon.recruitee.com.
 *
 * Sector: IT monitoring / Software editor. HQ: Paris, France.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `centreon`
 * (`https://centreon.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
