/**
 * Minted — Design marketplace that crowdsources and sells art, stationery, and home goods.
 *
 * Minted is a design marketplace that crowdsources artwork from independent
 * artists and sells stationery, art, and home goods online. Its marketplace
 * operations team supports third-party sellers on the platform.
 *
 * Sector: Marketplaces / E-commerce. HQ: San Francisco, California, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `minted`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/minted`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
