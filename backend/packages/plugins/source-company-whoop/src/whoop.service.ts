/**
 * WHOOP — Wearable technology company for continuous physiological and health monitoring.
 *
 * WHOOP designs a wrist-worn wearable and subscription platform that tracks
 * physiological metrics such as heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep,
 * and recovery, including healthcare-oriented product lines.
 *
 * Sector: Health Tech / Wearables. HQ: Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
 *
 * Source: Lever job board, company slug `whoop`
 * (`https://jobs.lever.co/whoop`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Lever. Rather than re-implement Lever parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Lever source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Lever field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
