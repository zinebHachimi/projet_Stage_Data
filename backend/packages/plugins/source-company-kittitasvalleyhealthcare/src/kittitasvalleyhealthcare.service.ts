/**
 * Kittitas Valley Healthcare — Community hospital and clinic network serving Kittitas County, Washington.
 *
 * Kittitas Valley Healthcare is a public hospital district operating a
 * community hospital and a network of clinics in Kittitas County,
 * Washington. It provides acute care, emergency services, and primary and
 * specialty outpatient care.
 *
 * Sector: Healthcare / Hospital System. HQ: Ellensburg, Washington, USA.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `KittitasValleyHealthcare`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/KittitasValleyHealthcare`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
