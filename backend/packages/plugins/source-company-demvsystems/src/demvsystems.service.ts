/**
 * DEMV Systems — Broker-management software for the insurance and financial-advisory sector.
 *
 * DEMV Systems GmbH develops software for the insurance and
 * financial-advisory sector; its main product is a broker-management system
 * that digitizes administrative and advisory processes. It is headquartered
 * in Hamburg.
 *
 * Sector: Insurtech software. HQ: Hamburg, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `demvsystems`
 * (`https://demvsystems.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
