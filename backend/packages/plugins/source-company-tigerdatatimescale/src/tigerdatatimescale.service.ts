/**
 * TigerData (Timescale) — Postgres-based time-series and analytics database company, formerly Timescale.
 *
 * TigerData, formerly known as Timescale, develops a Postgres-based database
 * for time-series and analytical workloads and offers Tiger Cloud as its
 * managed service. The company hires across engineering, sales, and
 * customer-facing roles with globally distributed remote positions including
 * the US, Spain, and India.
 *
 * Sector: Databases / Time-Series. HQ: New York, New York, USA.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `tigerdata`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/tigerdata`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
