/**
 * VIKTOR — Low-code application development platform for engineers to build and deploy web apps.
 *
 * VIKTOR is a Rotterdam-based SaaS company offering a Python-based low-code
 * platform that lets engineers build, deploy, and share web applications and
 * automate engineering workflows without front-end development.
 *
 * Sector: Engineering / low-code SaaS. HQ: Rotterdam, Netherlands.
 *
 * Source: Recruitee careers board, subdomain `viktor`
 * (`https://viktor.recruitee.com`). The company's live postings
 * are served by Recruitee. Rather than re-implement Recruitee parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Recruitee source plugin
 * from the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field
 * mapping to it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id
 * prefix) onto the results — so every Recruitee field fix is inherited
 * automatically. This honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly;
 * discover via the registry" rule.
