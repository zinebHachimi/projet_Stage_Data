/**
 * Reality Defender — Multi-modal AI-generated media and deepfake detection platform.
 *
 * Reality Defender provides multi-modal detection of AI-generated media to
 * help enterprises and governments identify deepfakes and prevent related
 * fraud and disinformation in real time. It is a Y Combinator graduate
 * backed by DCVC.
 *
 * Sector: Deepfake Detection & Fraud. HQ: New York, New York, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `realitydefender`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/realitydefender`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
