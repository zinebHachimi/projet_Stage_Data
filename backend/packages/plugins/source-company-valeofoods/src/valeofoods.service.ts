/**
 * Valeo Foods — Food manufacturer producing snacks, confectionery, and grocery products across multiple brands.
 *
 * Valeo Foods is an Ireland-based food company that manufactures and markets
 * a portfolio of consumer food brands. Categories include snacking,
 * confectionery, baking, and grocery staples sold across Europe and beyond.
 * The group grows through a mix of owned brands and acquisitions.
 *
 * Sector: Food consumer goods (CPG). HQ: Dublin, Ireland.
 *
 * Source: SmartRecruiters job board, company identifier `valeofoods`
 * (`https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/valeofoods`). The company's live
 * postings are served by SmartRecruiters. Rather than re-implement
 * SmartRecruiters parsing (and risk drift), this plugin resolves the
 * registered SmartRecruiters source plugin from the `PluginRegistry` at
 * runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to it, then re-stamps the
 * company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto the results — so every
 * SmartRecruiters field fix is inherited automatically. This honours the "no
 * plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the registry" rule.
