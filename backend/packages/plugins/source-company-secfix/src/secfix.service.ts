/**
 * Secfix — Security compliance automation platform for European companies.
 *
 * Secfix automates security compliance, helping companies achieve and
 * maintain certifications such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and TISAX. It
 * focuses on reducing the manual effort involved in compliance programs,
 * with an emphasis on the European market.
 *
 * Sector: Security Compliance. HQ: Munich, Bavaria, Germany.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `secfix`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/secfix`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
