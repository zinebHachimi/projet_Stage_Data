/**
 * Lightspark — Builds open payment infrastructure using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.
 *
 * Lightspark builds payment infrastructure for sending and receiving money
 * using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Its enterprise tools include
 * Grid, Node, and Spark for instant, low-cost transfers. The company focuses
 * on open payment protocols.
 *
 * Sector: Bitcoin / payments infrastructure. HQ: Los Angeles, California, United States.
 *
 * Source: Ashby job board, company slug `lightspark`
 * (`https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/lightspark`). The company's live
 * postings are served by Ashby. Rather than re-implement Ashby parsing (and
 * risk drift), this plugin resolves the registered Ashby source plugin from
 * the `PluginRegistry` at runtime and delegates the fetch + field mapping to
 * it, then re-stamps the company identity (site, companyName, id prefix) onto
 * the results — so every Ashby field fix is inherited automatically. This
 * honours the "no plugin imports a peer plugin directly; discover via the
 * registry" rule.
