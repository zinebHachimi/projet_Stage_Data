## Q-WORKABLE-1 — Workable board-name anchor + empty-but-real accounts

**Context:** Spec 1677. The public Workable widget API
(`https://apply.workable.com/api/v1/widget/accounts/<slug>`) returns HTTP 200 with
a `{ name, description, jobs: [...] }` envelope for **every real account** — even
ones with **zero open roles** (`jobs: []`) — while a non-existent slug returns a
plain-text `Not Found`. The `name` field is usually just the account slug echoed
back, not a polished brand name. Many well-known brands own a Workable account but
currently host zero live roles (having paused hiring or migrated backends).

**Options:**

- **A. Gate on job-count only (`jobs.length >= MIN_JOBS = 3`, each title-bearing);
  capture the envelope `name` as informational `boardName`; enforce brand-match at
  descriptor-assembly time** (the verified `displayName` + `companySlug` pair
  supplied by discovery). An empty-but-real account simply fails the gate.
- **B. Hard brand-match the wire `name` against the claimed display name** —
  useless here, because `name` is normally the slug, not the brand.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — consistent with
Q-RECRUITEE-1 / Q-SR-1 / Q-LEVER-1 / Q-ASHBY-1. The count gate naturally excludes
the many empty-but-real Workable accounts; `boardName` is retained for
auditability only.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-RECRUITEE-2 — Recruitee per-company subdomain host model

**Context:** Spec 1593. Unlike the four earlier backends (Greenhouse, Ashby,
Lever, SmartRecruiters), which all serve every board from a **shared API host**
with the company slug in a path segment, **Recruitee** hosts each board on its own
**subdomain**: `https://<slug>.recruitee.com/api/offers`. The slug is therefore
interpolated into the DNS host rather than a URL path.

**Options:**

- **A. Interpolate the slug into the host** via a small `boardUrl(slug)` helper
  (`https://${encodeURIComponent(slug)}.recruitee.com/api/offers`), and keep the
  usual `companySlug` (live subdomain) / `slug` (plugin dir/enum) split even though
  Recruitee subdomains are conventionally lowercase and the two usually coincide.
- **B. Assume slug == subdomain and drop `companySlug`** — loses parity with the
  other four pipelines and breaks on any mixed-case / punctuated subdomain.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — one-line host builder, retains the
`companySlug`/`slug` split for pipeline symmetry and forward-safety. The delegated
`source-ats-recruitee` plugin already builds the same subdomain URL, so the probe
and the runtime plugin agree.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-RECRUITEE-1 — Recruitee board-name anchor: where do we enforce brand-match?

**Context:** Spec 1593. Like SmartRecruiters (and unlike Ashby/Lever), each
Recruitee offer carries `company_name` on the wire, so a board display name IS
available from `https://<slug>.recruitee.com/api/offers`.

**Options:**

- **A. Gate on job-count only; capture `company_name` as informational
  `boardName`; enforce brand-match at descriptor-assembly time** (the verified
  `displayName` + `companySlug` pair supplied by discovery).
- **B. Hard brand-match the wire `company_name` against the claimed display name**
  — brittle (legal-entity vs. brand mismatches, localised names).

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — consistent with Q-SR-1 / Q-LEVER-1 / Q-ASHBY-1.
Discovery self-verifies each subdomain against the live API (≥3 title-bearing
offers), and the central deterministic probe re-gates every candidate before
scaffolding. `boardName` is retained for auditability only.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-SR-2 — SmartRecruiters case-sensitive identifier vs. plugin-dir naming

**Context:** Spec 1375. The SmartRecruiters public Posting API is keyed on a
**case-sensitive company identifier** (e.g. `BoschGroup`, `WesternDigital`,
`Visa`), whereas a plugin dir / `Site` enum value must be a clean, hyphen-free,
**lowercase** token and the enum KEY must be a valid TS identifier (cannot begin
with a digit).

**Options:**

- **A. Carry two fields:** `companySlug` (the exact case-sensitive identifier,
  used on the wire) and `slug` (the lowercase, alnum-only plugin dir / enum value
  / `id` prefix, derived from the canonical display name). Reject any candidate
  whose display-name-derived `enumKey` starts with a digit or collides with an
  existing enum key/value.
- **B. Lower-case the identifier for the wire too** — breaks, because the
  SmartRecruiters API 404s / returns `totalFound: 0` on the wrong casing.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — mirrors the Lever/Ashby resolution
(Q-LEVER-2 / Q-ASHBY-2). `assemble-smartrecruiters-batch.ts` derives `slug`,
`className`, `enumKey` from the display name and preserves `companySlug` verbatim,
with digit-prefix + collision rejection.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-SR-1 — SmartRecruiters board-name anchor: where do we enforce brand-match?

**Context:** Spec 1375. Unlike Ashby/Lever (bare arrays, no board name), the
public SmartRecruiters Posting API envelope
(`https://api.smartrecruiters.com/v1/companies/<slug>/postings`) **does** expose
`content[i].company.name`, so a board display name IS available on the wire.

**Options:**

- **A. Gate on job-count only; capture `company.name` as informational
  `boardName`; enforce brand-match at descriptor-assembly time** (the verified
  `displayName` + `companySlug` pair supplied by discovery).
- **B. Hard brand-match the wire `company.name` against the claimed display name**
  — brittle (legal-entity vs. brand mismatches: `BoschGroup` → "Bosch Group").
- **C. Authenticated Customer API** — richer metadata but requires a per-company
  key; not viable for public discovery.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — consistent with Q-LEVER-1 / Q-ASHBY-1.
Discovery self-verified each identifier against the live API (≥3 title-bearing
postings), and the central deterministic probe re-gates every candidate before
scaffolding. `boardName` is retained for auditability only.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-LEVER-2 — Lever slug vs. plugin-dir naming for hyphenated/dotted slugs

**Context:** Spec 1194. A live Lever slug may contain hyphens or dots (e.g.
`spear-ai`, `arcteryx.com`, `cscgeneration-2`), but a plugin dir / `Site` enum
value must be a clean, hyphen-free token, and the enum KEY must be a valid TS
identifier (cannot begin with a digit).

**Options:**

- **A. Carry two fields:** `companySlug` (the live Lever slug, used on the wire)
  and `slug` (the hyphen-free plugin dir / enum value / `id` prefix, derived by
  lower-casing + stripping non-alphanumerics). Reject any candidate whose
  display-name-derived `enumKey` starts with a digit.
- **B. Force the plugin dir to equal the raw Lever slug** — breaks on dots and
  collides with the enum-identifier rules.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — mirrors the Ashby resolution (Q-ASHBY-2). The
scaffolder writes `Site.<ENUMKEY> = '<slug>'` and delegates
`scrape({ ...input, companySlug })`.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-LEVER-1 — Lever has no board-name anchor: where do we enforce brand-match?

**Context:** Spec 1194. Like the public Ashby Posting API (Q-ASHBY-1), the public
Lever Postings API (`https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/<slug>?mode=json`) returns
a **bare JSON array** of postings with **no board / org display name** — so the
Greenhouse-style board-name brand anchor does not exist on the wire.

**Options:**

- **A. Gate on job-count only; enforce brand-match at descriptor-assembly time**
  (the verified `displayName` + `companySlug` pair supplied by discovery).
- **B. Cross-check a posting's `hostedUrl` host to confirm the slug belongs to
  the claimed brand.**
- **C. Use the authenticated Lever API (returns richer metadata) — requires a
  per-company key; not viable for public discovery.**

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — identical to the Ashby resolution. Discovery
self-verified each slug against the live API (≥3 title-bearing postings), and the
central deterministic probe re-gates every candidate before scaffolding.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-ASHBY-1 — Ashby has no board-name anchor: where do we enforce brand-match?

**Context:** Spec 975. The Greenhouse company-source probe gates partly on the
board's `name` field (`https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>` →
`{ name }`) as a brand-match anchor. The **public Ashby Posting API**
(`https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/<slug>`) returns only
`{ apiVersion, jobs[] }` — **no board/org display name** — so that anchor does
not exist on the wire.

**Options:**

- **A. Gate on job-count only; enforce brand-match at descriptor-assembly time**
  (the verified `displayName` + `companySlug` pair supplied by discovery, which
  already confirmed the slug maps to the real company).
- **B. Additionally cross-check the company's careers page / a job's `jobUrl`
  host to confirm the slug belongs to the claimed brand.**
- **C. Use the authenticated Posting API (returns org metadata) — requires a
  per-company API key; not viable for public discovery.**

**Default (proceeding):** **A.** The probe gate is purely count-based
(`jobs.length >= 3`, title-bearing); brand-match is a discovery-time
responsibility (the researcher confirms the slug↔company mapping before the slug
enters the batch). B is a cheap future hardening; C is out of scope (no keys).

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-ASHBY-2 — Ashby slug vs. plugin-dir/enum naming for hyphenated slugs

**Context:** Spec 975. Ashby board slugs frequently contain hyphens
(`allen-control-systems`), but plugin directories, `Site` enum values, and
`JobPostDto` id prefixes in this repo use hyphen-free identifiers
(`allencontrolsystems`). The Greenhouse pipeline conflated the two (board slug
== plugin slug). The Ashby descriptor therefore needs two fields.

**Options:**

- **A. Carry both: `companySlug` (real Ashby board slug, hyphens allowed) +
  `slug` (hyphen-free plugin dir / enum value / id prefix, derived from the
  display name).**
- **B. Keep hyphens everywhere (dir `source-company-allen-control-systems`,
  enum value `'allen-control-systems'`).**
- **C. Strip hyphens from the Ashby slug (it then 404s — the board no longer
  resolves).**

**Default (proceeding):** **A.** Matches the existing
`source-company-allencontrolsystems` precedent (dir/enum hyphen-free, board slug
`allen-control-systems`), keeps enum members clean, and never breaks the live
fetch. C is wrong (breaks resolution); B diverges from precedent.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-072 — workatastartup: harvest the YC public mirror or the canonical WaaS board?

**Context:** Spec 5023. YC Work at a Startup exposes the same board at two URL
shapes: the canonical `workatastartup.com/companies/{slug}` (thin, auth-gated —
the full job list and apply flow sit behind a login) and the public YC mirror
`ycombinator.com/companies/{slug}/jobs` (server-renders an Inertia `data-page`
blob enumerating every opening, plus per-job detail pages with schema.org
`JobPosting` ld+json). Note the URL shapes are **not** interchangeable: the
canonical host 404s if you append `/jobs`, and the mirror needs the `/jobs`
suffix.

**Options:**

- **A. Harvest the YC mirror (current).** Public, unauthenticated, fully
  structured (Inertia list spine + ld+json detail). `companyUrl` still points at
  the canonical `workatastartup.com` board for correctness. No auth, no
  Playwright; matches how fetch1 detection already classifies these domains.
- **B. Harvest the canonical `workatastartup.com` board.** Authoritative host,
  but the job list/apply data is auth-gated, so it needs a logged-in session
  (Playwright + credentials) — heavy, brittle, and out of scope for a public
  source plugin.
- **C. Try canonical first, fall back to the mirror.** Extra fetch + redirect
  handling for no data gain, since the mirror already carries everything.

**Default (proceeding):** **A.** The YC mirror is the only public, fully
structured surface; `companyUrl` records the canonical WaaS board so downstream
URL semantics stay correct.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-071 — source-jsonld: how should the generic JSON-LD harvester enumerate jobs from a single page?

**Context:** Spec 5022. The generic `source-jsonld` plugin is a last-resort
harvester for sites with no recognised ATS. It is given one careers/job URL
(`companyUrl`) and reads the `JobPosting` ld+json blocks on **that page**. Some
sites embed every posting's ld+json on the careers index (an `ItemList` of
`JobPosting`s), others only embed a single `JobPosting` on each per-job detail
page and list jobs via JS/links the harvester can't enumerate.

**Options:**

- **A. Single-page only (current).** Parse whatever `JobPosting` blocks exist on
  the supplied URL — an `ItemList`/`@graph` index yields many jobs, a detail
  page yields one. No crawling. Deterministic, cheap, no link-following
  heuristics; but misses sites that paginate via links rather than embedding an
  index.
- **B. Follow on-page job links one level deep** and parse each target's
  ld+json. Recovers link-driven boards, but adds N fetches per page, link-intent
  heuristics, and concurrency/robots concerns — overlaps the fetch1
  apply-link-discovery work.
- **C. Require the caller to pass each job URL** (treat the plugin as a pure
  per-URL extractor). Simplest contract, but pushes enumeration entirely
  upstream.

**Default (proceeding):** **A.** Keep the harvester a single-page extractor:
it covers the embedded-`ItemList` and per-detail-page cases with zero crawl
risk, and link-following enumeration belongs in the dedicated fetch1 discovery
spec, not the ever-jobs source plugin.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-070 — Manatal: how should the omitted pay interval be derived from careers-page.com salary fields?

**Context:** Spec 5021. The careers-page.com JSON API exposes `salary_min` /
`salary_max` (decimal strings, only when `is_salary_visible`) and a
`currency_code`, but **no pay interval** (hourly/monthly/yearly). Real data
mixes scales: castelion-corporation has both $40–$50 (hourly) and $140k–$180k
(yearly) bands, both flagged visible.

**Options:**

- **A. Infer the interval from the amount magnitude** using the same thresholds
  as the shared text parser (`< 350` hourly, `< 30000` monthly, else yearly).
  Consistent with `extractSalary`; correct on all observed data.
- **B. Always assume yearly.** Simplest, but mislabels hourly roles (the
  castelion $40–$50 bands would read as $40–$50/yr).
- **C. Omit the interval entirely when the API doesn't state it.** Avoids any
  guess, but `CompensationDto` needs an interval and downstream consumers expect
  one; loses normalization.

**Default (proceeding):** **A.** Magnitude inference with the shared thresholds
keeps Manatal consistent with every other plugin's text path and is correct on
all captured fixtures; the structured min/max remain exact regardless.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-069 — Should the Paylocity plugin keep chasing the JSON feed endpoint, or commit to board-page HTML?

**Context:** Spec 5020. The plugin relied on
`/recruiting/api/feed/jobs/{GUID}`, which returns HTTP 500 (by GUID) or 400 (by
numeric ModuleId) for every tested company. The board page itself never calls
that feed — jobs are server-rendered into `window.pageData` — so the feed is a
separate syndication endpoint that appears disabled/partner-key-gated. The IDs
are not the blocker; the endpoint is.

**Options:**

- **A. Commit to the board page + per-job detail page (HTML).** Proven for all
  tested boards; one detail fetch per job (bounded concurrency).
- **B. Keep using the feed, gated behind a Paylocity partner API key.** Requires
  credentials we don't have and that the public board never uses.
- **C. Board page only (no detail overlay).** Cheaper, but the board's per-job
  `Description` is empty and Job Type / compensation live only on the detail
  page — would lose description, jobType, and text-fallback compensation.

**Default (proceeding):** **A.** The board + detail HTML is the only reliable,
key-free public source and yields the full field set. If Paylocity later exposes
a keyed feed, the structured-first `resolveCompensation` contract and the typed
layer make re-adding it incremental.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-068 — How should one `LocationDto` represent a multi-location Workday job?

**Context.** Workday's list endpoint may collapse geography to `"2 Locations"`; its detail
endpoint exposes a primary `location` and `additionalLocations[]`. The shared `JobPostDto` accepts
only one `LocationDto`, and `LocationDto` has scalar `city`, `state`, and `country` fields rather
than a location array. Spec 5004 must preserve every concrete label without changing the public DTO.

**Options.**

- **A — Join concrete labels in `city` with `; ` (chosen default).** Lossless within the existing
  contract, deterministic, human-readable, and distinguishable from commas inside each location.
- **B — Emit only the primary location.** Structurally pure but silently discards valid cities.
- **C — Add `locations: LocationDto[]` to `JobPostDto`.** Best long-term shape, but broadens a
  targeted Workday bug fix into a public cross-source contract migration.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — deduplicate case-insensitively, keep source order, and join with
`; `. A future DTO-versioning spec may adopt C across all multi-location sources.

**Resolution.** _(pending human review — default A continues.)_

---

## Q-067 — Liveness checker integration point: where should the aggregator invoke `ILivenessChecker`?

**Context.** Spec 721 (ad-hoc session 2026-06-11) ships the `liveness-http` feature plugin bound
under `LIVENESS_CHECKER_TOKEN`, with the public contract (`ILivenessChecker`, `LivenessVerdict`)
in `@ever-jobs/models`. The plugin is wired (tsconfig path alias + jest mapper) but nothing in the
aggregation pipeline invokes it yet — the spec deliberately scopes out verdict persistence and
re-check scheduling. The open question is where the checker should plug into the pipeline.

**Options.**
- **A — Opt-in post-aggregation step (chosen default).** Consumers (API callers, store maintenance
  jobs) inject `LIVENESS_CHECKER_TOKEN` and call `checkBatch` explicitly on stored or returned
  URLs. Zero impact on scrape latency; verdict handling stays caller-owned.
- **B — Inline during aggregation.** Check every scraped URL before results are returned. Adds one
  GET per job to every search (hundreds of extra requests, multi-second latency) for URLs that were
  just fetched from the source and are almost certainly live.
- **C — Persistence-layer hook.** Run liveness checks at write/refresh time inside the persistence
  plugins. Couples feature plugins to each other (forbidden by the plugin architecture) unless a
  new orchestration interface mediates.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — the plugin ships as an injectable capability with **no automatic
invocation yet**; a later spec owns the maintenance-job consumer (store eviction for `expired`
verdicts, retry cadence for `uncertain` ones).

**Resolution.** _(pending human review — default A continues.)_

---

## Q-066 — Liveness checker: add a browser-rendering fallback for `bot_challenge` verdicts?

**Context.** Spec 721's HTTP-only checker classifies anti-bot interstitials (Cloudflare
"just a moment", hCaptcha, press-and-hold) as `uncertain`/`bot_challenge` — it never attempts to
solve or render them (Spec 721 §3 non-goal). SPA-only boards that server-render nothing similarly
land in `uncertain`/`no_apply_control`. A headless-browser fallback could resolve many of these to
a definitive `active`/`expired` verdict, at a significant dependency and latency cost.

**Options.**
- **A — HTTP-only for now (chosen default).** Uncertain verdicts are **never treated as expired**
  (Spec 721 NFR-5), so the worst case is a stale posting surviving until a later, smarter pass —
  no false-positive evictions. Zero new runtime dependencies (NFR-3).
- **B — Headless-browser fallback feature plugin.** A second plugin (e.g. `liveness-browser`)
  re-checks `bot_challenge`/`uncertain` verdicts with real rendering. Heavy dependency, far slower,
  and challenge pages may still block automation.
- **C — Escalation queue.** Persist `uncertain` verdicts and re-check on a cadence with jittered
  timing / rotated proxies before ever considering browser rendering.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — HTTP-only; uncertain verdicts stay non-destructive by contract.
Revisit B/C only if a real consumer measures a material `bot_challenge` share on stored URLs.

**Resolution.** _(pending human review — default A continues.)_

---

## Q-065 — solid.jobs division coverage: which divisions should `source-solidjobs` scrape by default?

**Context.** The solid.jobs public API exposes eight live-verified divisions (probe 2026-06-11:
`it` 500, `sales` 377, `finances` 237, `marketing` 202, `logistics` 155, `engineering` 137,
`other` 126, `hr` 113 offers). Each configured division costs one HTTP request per scrape. Spec 718
D-2 scopes the default to `it` only.

**Options.**
- **A — `it` only by default, env override (chosen default).** `SOLIDJOBS_DIVISIONS`
  (comma-separated) widens coverage without a code change; fan-out via `Promise.allSettled` so one
  failing division never blanks the rest.
- **B — All eight divisions by default.** 8× the request volume per scrape, mostly for divisions
  outside the aggregator's core tech focus.
- **C — Hardcode a curated subset (e.g. `it,engineering`).** Picks winners without usage data and
  still needs the env override for the rest.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — `it` only; operators opt into more divisions via the
`SOLIDJOBS_DIVISIONS` env var.

**Resolution.** _(pending human review — default A continues.)_

---

## Q-064 — Should `source-solidjobs` default `LocationDto.country` to "Poland" when a city is present?

**Context.** Every offer in the solid.jobs snapshot probed 2026-06-11 lists Polish cities, but the
wire payload carries no country field, and the board could list foreign locations later. Spec 718
FR-6/Q-1 maps `location.city = locations[0]` and leaves `state`/`country` `null`.

**Options.**
- **A — City only; `country` stays `null` (chosen default).** No fabricated facts on the DTO;
  downstream enrichment can geocode the city when a country is required.
- **B — Default `country = "Poland"` whenever a city is present.** Correct for the probed snapshot
  but silently wrong the day the board carries a non-Polish location.
- **C — Polish-city allowlist.** Set the country only when the city matches a maintained list — a
  maintenance burden disproportionate to the benefit.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — city only; `country` remains `null` until the wire payload
provides evidence.

**Resolution.** _(pending human review — default A continues.)_

## Q-063 — Build method for Greenhouse company-direct source batches: deterministic main-loop probe vs. parallel research-agent workflow

**Context.** Run #415 pivoted from generic ATS adapters back to company-direct sources, shipping 17
new Greenhouse-hosted plugins (Specs 427–443). Unlike ATS adapters — which need genuine per-platform
research of pagination and (often anonymous) auth flows and therefore justify a fan-out of research
subagents — the company-direct Greenhouse template is fully deterministic: every plugin hits the
same public `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs` shape, and the only per-company facts
needed are (a) which slug is a live valid board, (b) the board's real brand name, and (c) a few real
listings for the fixture. All three are obtained by a direct API probe in the main loop.

**Options.**
- **A — Deterministic main-loop probe (chosen default).** `curl`/`fetch` each candidate slug + the
  board-meta endpoint, keep boards that return ≥3 live roles AND whose `name` matches the intended
  brand, capture 3 real listings into the fixture, then run the `scaffold-company-source.ts` batch
  generator. Cheapest, fastest, fully reproducible; and it is what caught the `remote` → "General
  Assembly Remote Jobs" and ambiguous `warp`/`knock`/`ghost` mis-mapping traps this run.
- **B — Parallel research-agent workflow.** Spawn one agent per candidate to research + verify +
  compose the descriptor. Higher token cost and more variance for facts the probe already returns
  deterministically; reserves its real value (auth-flow discovery) for a problem company-direct
  Greenhouse boards do not have.
- **C — Hybrid.** Deterministic probe for slug/brand/listing verification, plus a light agent pass
  only for prose metadata (sector/HQ/description) on companies the main loop does not already know.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** for Greenhouse company-direct batches; reserve the parallel-agent
workflow (Option B) for ATS adapters that require per-platform auth-flow research. Revisit toward C
if a future batch targets less-well-known companies whose sector/HQ the main loop cannot author
accurately.

**Resolution.** _(pending human review — default A continues.)_

## Q-062 — Live re-confirmation pass for the 3 other defensive ATS surfaces shipped in run #414 (Expr3ss, Connexys, HReasily)

**Context:** Run #414 shipped 12 new `source-ats-*` adapters (Specs 415–426). **8 were verified live
2026-06-04** (Employment Hero, Talentera, Subscribe-HR, Access PeopleHR, Breathe HR, VidCruiter,
Sympa, CVWarehouse). **4 are defensive (`verified=false`)**: Roubler (tracked separately in Q-061),
plus three here:

- **Expr3ss (Spec 419)** — the whole `*.expr3ss.com` board surface is behind an edge
  managed-challenge (HTTP 403 + `Cf-Mitigated: challenge`) for non-browser clients, so the
  schema.org JSON-LD / apply-anchor payload could not be extracted from a plain HTTP client this
  run. Many real tenants confirmed live (cos, dnata, kelsian, krispykreme); only the anonymous
  payload capture failed.
- **Connexys (Spec 425)** — the documented public XML vacancy-feed URL contract + Dutch/English
  field vocabulary were established, but the legacy `www.connexys.nl` host answered HTTP 400 during
  Connexys's Salesforce-platform migration, so an anonymous body could not be re-confirmed
  end-to-end. Defensive multi-alias parsing throughout.
- **HReasily (Spec 426)** — platform identity, SEA/SG footprint, and the ATS module were confirmed,
  but the candidate career-page host/path + public feed are undocumented and require a hiring tenant,
  so the `careers.hreasily.com/{slug}` + JSON-LD contract is a best-effort model.

**Options:**
- A. Ship all three defensively (`verified=false`), each degrading to empty on any non-conforming
  response, and re-confirm in a later run (e2e suites tolerate zero results, so CI stays green).
- B. Defer these three until an anonymous response is captured (leaves their catalogues
  un-ingestable indefinitely).

**Default (proceeding):** A. All three ship `verified=false` with the surface flagged throughout
(constants JSDoc, service JSDoc, spec §10, e2e header). Flip to `verified=true` once an anonymous
response is captured — Expr3ss needs a browser-grade fetch to clear the edge challenge; Connexys
needs the post-migration feed host; HReasily needs a live hiring tenant.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-061 — Roubler (Spec 418) public careers feed shape unconfirmed (verified=FALSE)

**Context:** Live research on 2026-06-04 confirmed Roubler's platform, its shared candidate-facing
SPA host `app.roubler.com` (region aliases `app.roubler.com.au` + `production.roubler.net` both
301 → it), and the region-sharded backend `graphql.au.roubler.com` with a `/static/` REST
namespace advertised in the board's runtime `config.js`. But no *anonymous* careers-feed JSON / RSS
/ JSON-LD response was capturable: the board is client-rendered (empty `<title>`, no server-side
JobPosting JSON-LD), `graphql.au.roubler.com/graphql` returns an auth error anonymously, and every
`/static/*` path returns HTTP 403 anonymously.

**Options:**
- A. Ship a defensive best-effort model of the documented public careers feed
  (`/static/careers/{companyId}/adverts`), narrow every field, degrade to empty on any
  non-conforming response — verified=FALSE.
- B. Defer the adapter until an anonymous response is captured (leaves the AU/APAC Roubler catalogue
  un-ingestable indefinitely).
- C. Use the authenticated GraphQL backend (out of scope — requires per-tenant credentials).

**Default (proceeding):** A. The `source-ats-roubler` package + Spec 418 ship with the feed shape /
path / pagination flagged verified=FALSE throughout (constants JSDoc, service JSDoc, spec §10 D-1,
e2e header). Every network test tolerates zero results, so the suite passes whether or not the
public feed responds anonymously. Re-confirm and flip to verified=true once an anonymous careers
response is captured against a live tenant.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-060 — Live re-confirmation pass for the 3 defensive ATS surfaces shipped in run #413 (HROne, Workwise, Beamery)

**Context:** Run #413 shipped 10 new `source-ats-*` adapters (Specs 405–414). **7 were
verified live 2026-06-04/03** (Apploi, Kenjo, Sesame HR, Recruiteze, Sense, Radancy,
Symphony Talent). **3 are defensive (verified=false)** because the public anonymous job feed
could not be confirmed live this run:
  - `source-ats-hrone` (HROne, hrone.cloud, India HRMS) — per-tenant career site documented
    from public evidence; anonymous JSON shape unconfirmed.
  - `source-ats-workwise` (Workwise, workwise.io, German SMB recruiting) — public job
    widget/board surface documented best-effort.
  - `source-ats-beamery` (Beamery, beamery.com, enterprise talent CRM) — public career-site
    surface documented best-effort.
All three compile, register in all four shared points, and pass the tolerant 5-test e2e
contract (empty results are acceptable), so they degrade gracefully today but may return 0
roles against real tenants until the wire shape is confirmed.

**Options:**

- **A. Schedule a dedicated live re-confirmation pass** (a future run probes real tenants
  with WebFetch, tightens the constants/types to the observed shape, and flips verified=true
  where confirmed).
- **B. Leave them defensive indefinitely** — they cost nothing when a tenant has no public
  feed and self-correct if the documented shape happens to be right.
- **C. Remove the unconfirmed adapters** — contradicts the "do not remove" rule and discards
  useful scaffolding.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — track the three for a live re-confirmation pass on a future
run; keep them shipped (degrade gracefully) in the meantime. Matches the run-#412 precedent
for Sage People / Cezanne (flagged for live re-confirmation, kept shipped).

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-059 — Systemic fix for live-host e2e timeout flakiness (default `requestTimeout` 60s > 30s test budget)

**Context:** Run #407 CI repeatedly red on the **Test (Source Scrapers)** job because
two ATS adapters (`source-ats-beetween`, `source-ats-jobtrain`) hit third-party
career hosts that **connect-then-hang**. `ScraperInputDto` defaults
`requestTimeout` to **60s** (set in the constructor before `Object.assign`), and the
shared `createHttpClient` maps that to the axios instance timeout. The collocated
e2e tests have a **30s** jest budget, so any hanging host blows the budget and fails
the whole suite. Most dead hosts return a *fast* error (ENOTFOUND/404/500) and are
unaffected; only the rare connect-then-hang host triggers the 60s wait. Two
secondary defects compound this:
  1. `createHttpClient`'s factory honors the **`requestTimeout`** key but silently
     ignores a bare **`timeout`** key on its proxy/requestTimeout branch — most
     adapters pass `timeout: input.requestTimeout`, so on a proxied path the cap is
     lost and the 60s HttpClient default applies.
  2. A plain `?? fallback` on `input.requestTimeout` never triggers because the DTO
     default (60) is non-nullish — adapters must **cap** (`Math.min`), not fall back.

**Interim fix applied (run #407):** capped `requestTimeout` at **15s** via `Math.min`
in the two failing adapters (`BEETWEEN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
`JOBTRAIN_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) and switched them to the `requestTimeout` key.
Verified `createHttpClient({ requestTimeout: 15 })` yields a 15000ms axios timeout.

**Options for the durable, systemic fix:**

- **A. Lower the `ScraperInputDto` default `requestTimeout` from 60s → 20s.** One line;
  brings every adapter under the 30s budget on the no-proxy path and speeds
  production degradation on dead tenants. Risk: a production caller relying on 60s
  for a genuinely slow large feed (can still set it explicitly).
- **B. Fix the `createHttpClient` factory** so `timeout` is honored as a fallback for
  `requestTimeout` (`timeout: options.requestTimeout ?? options.timeout`) AND add a
  hard upper cap (e.g. 30s) regardless of input. Centralizes the bound; medium blast
  radius across all sources.
- **C. Per-adapter caps only** (current approach) — apply a `Math.min(...)` cap in each
  adapter that hits a flaky host, as discovered. Lowest blast radius; risks
  whack-a-mole if more connect-then-hang hosts appear.

**Default (proceeding):** **C** for now (applied to Beetween + Jobtrain) because it is
the lowest-risk change and the failing population is small (most dead hosts fast-fail).
Recommend the owner adopt **A** (or **A+B**) as the durable systemic fix — it removes
the budget mismatch for all ~100 adapters at once. Holding off on A/B autonomously
because it changes core DTO/HTTP behavior for every source (a product decision) and a
concurrent run was active on shared files.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-058 — Prescreen candidate-host rebrand churn (jobbase.io → prescreenapp.io → onlyfy.jobs)

**Context:** The Prescreen (Spec 330) candidate portal has rebranded twice;
legacy `{handle}.jobbase.io` / `{handle}.prescreenapp.io` hosts 301-redirect to
`{handle}.onlyfy.jobs`, and the old anonymous JSON feed is retired (HTTP 404).
The adapter targets `onlyfy.jobs` and treats `handle` as the stable key.

**Options:** **A** — target `onlyfy.jobs` directly, rely on redirects for legacy
inputs *(chosen)*; **B** — maintain a host-alias table and follow redirects
explicitly; **C** — wait for a stable public API.

**Default:** **A** — `handle` survives the rebrands; the HTTP client follows
redirects. Re-evaluate if the host changes again.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-057 — PCRecruiter stateful pagination token

**Context:** PCRecruiter (Spec 329) paginates via a stateful POST to a
server-issued `pcr-id` token + `unifiedsearch` cursor + `morecount` index, not a
simple `?page=n`. The adapter replicates this best-effort, bounded by
`MAX_PAGES=20`, and always retains page-1 results.

**Default:** **A** — best-effort token-replay pagination, page-1 guaranteed,
never throws. Revisit if tenants with >480 roles under-collect.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-056 — rexx systems multi-page listing portals

**Context:** rexx systems (Spec 328) tenants typically render all roles on one
`/stellenangebote.html` page (via `data-count`), so the adapter parses only the
first listing page.

**Default:** **A** — single listing page + per-job detail fan-out. Add page
walking if a paginated tenant is observed.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-055 — concludis tenant-variable / session-gated detail pages

**Context:** concludis (Spec 327) detail pages are tenant-variable: some
302-redirect or session-gate, and not all embed schema.org JSON-LD. Detail fetch
is best-effort (`Promise.allSettled`, concurrency 6); a role is never dropped for
missing enrichment — it degrades to the listing teaser + tenant-derived company.

**Default:** **A** — best-effort JSON-LD enrichment with listing-teaser fallback.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-054 — DigitalRecruiters multi-locale ingestion

**Context:** DigitalRecruiters (Spec 326) career sites can publish the same roles
under multiple region-qualified locales (e.g. `fr_FR`, `en_GB`). The adapter
ingests the tenant's default/config locale only to avoid duplicate roles.

**Default:** **A** — default-locale-only ingestion. Add opt-in multi-locale
fan-out (with cross-locale de-dup) if demand appears.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-053 — Teamdash `companySlug`-only resolution (opaque landing token)

**Context:** Teamdash (Spec 325) career-page URLs embed an opaque per-tenant
random landing token (`/p/job/{landingToken}/{slug}`) with no anonymous listing
API to discover it. `companyUrl` is the reliable input; `companySlug`-only
resolution makes a single best-effort attempt at the well-known `career-page`
slug and otherwise degrades to empty.

**Default:** **A** — prefer `companyUrl`; best-effort `companySlug` fallback.
A future seed-list should carry the full career-page URL for Teamdash tenants.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-052 — Adapters with no machine-readable publish date (Skeeled, Recruitis)

**Context:** Skeeled (Spec 324) board payloads and Recruitis (Spec 321) public
HTML expose no machine-readable publish date, so `datePosted` is left `null`. The
credentialed APIs of both carry a date but are out of scope.

**Default:** **A** — `datePosted: null` rather than guessing. Downstream
`hoursOld` filtering simply won't apply to these sources. Acceptable.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-051 — Recruitis localisation of listing chips

**Context:** Recruitis (Spec 321) public career-site chips (location / category /
employment / remote) are Czech-localised and positionally ordered. The remote
heuristic covers English + Czech markers (`home office`, `na dálku`); chip parsing
is ordinal with graceful absence.

**Default:** **A** — ordinal chip parse + bilingual remote heuristic, verified
stable across two tenants (recruitisio, allwyn).

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-050 — Softgarden: schema.org feed vs credentialed jobboard REST API

**Context:** Softgarden (Spec 320) documents v2/v3 jobboard REST APIs, but all
require a client/user token + `channelId` and are not anonymously usable. The
real anonymous surface is the React career page's schema.org
`GET {tenantOrigin}/jobs.feed.json`. Legacy Wicket boards lack this feed and
degrade to empty.

**Options:** **A** — use the anonymous `jobs.feed.json` schema.org feed
*(chosen)*; **B** — require per-tenant API credentials to call the REST API
(richer fields, but credential management + non-goal of "no auth").

**Default:** **A** — no-auth, verified live (10 jobs). The REST path can be added
later as an optional credentialed enrichment if needed.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-049 — Ceipal heuristic wire shape (tenant API-key rotation)

**Context:** Ceipal (Spec 319) exposes an anonymous career-portal API at
`https://api.ceipal.com/{apiKey}/job-postings/` — routing was confirmed live (the
key-validation envelope `{status:400,success:0,…}` proves the
`{apiKey}/{resource}/` family is active), but all three sampled tenant API keys
had rotated at verification time, so the per-row JSON shape was extracted
byte-for-byte from the platform's own public reference client rather than a live
job-list body. Hence `confidence: heuristic`, with layered field-drift fallbacks
(`position_title`→`job_title`, `public_job_desc`→`requistion_description`,
`id`→`job_id`, flat/data/results-wrapped detail bodies).

**Options:** **A** — ship now as heuristic with layered fallbacks and re-confirm
against a live key when one becomes available *(chosen)*; **B** — hold the
adapter until a live job-list body is captured; **C** — require callers to supply
a known-good key for verification.

**Default:** **A** — the adapter is contract-complete and degrades gracefully;
re-verify opportunistically. A live capture would upgrade it to `verified` with
no code change expected.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-048 — Composite tenant-identifier ergonomics for adapters that need more than a bare slug

**Context:** Several run #403 adapters cannot resolve a tenant from a single bare
slug. Applied (Spec 309) needs `{orgId}/{orgSlug}` (slug-only paths 404);
Workstream (Spec 314) needs `{accountId}/{brandSlug}` where `accountId` is an
opaque account UUID. The current convention overloads `companySlug` to carry the
composite (e.g. `1549/citizens-uk`, `36047dd7/jamba`) or accepts a full
`companyUrl`. This works but is undocumented at the seed/config layer and
non-obvious to a catalogue curator.

**Options:**

- **A** — Keep overloading `companySlug` with the composite token (slash-joined)
  + accept `companyUrl`; document the exact form per adapter in
  `ATS_INTEGRATIONS.md` and the spec. *(chosen default)*
- **B** — Add a generic structured `tenantParams: Record<string,string>` field to
  `ScraperInputDto` so adapters read named parts (`orgId`, `brandSlug`, …) instead
  of parsing a slash-joined slug. Cleaner, but a cross-cutting model change that
  touches every adapter and the seed schema.
- **C** — Add a per-adapter discovery helper that resolves a human-friendly slug
  to its composite id (e.g. brand-name → account UUID). Highest fidelity, but
  needs a reliable public lookup surface that may not exist.

**Default:** **A** — zero model churn, already works and is now documented. Revisit
as **B** if the count of composite-identifier adapters keeps growing (it is a
recurring shape: 2 of 10 this run).

---

## Q-047 — HTML-scraper fragility for adapters with no anonymous JSON API

**Context:** 4 of the 10 run #403 adapters have **no anonymous JSON API** and
parse server-rendered HTML: Applied (Spec 309, largest-prose-container heuristic
for descriptions), CATS (Spec 310, `.cats-job` selector cascade — `heuristic`
confidence), Workstream (Spec 314, link-extraction + detail fan-out — `heuristic`),
and Harri (Spec 315, Open Graph meta-tag extraction — `heuristic`). HTML surfaces
drift more readily than JSON contracts, so these adapters carry a higher
breakage risk than the verified-JSON adapters shipped alongside them (Recruit
CRM, Vincere, Oorwin, Eploy).

**Options:**

- **A** — Ship the HTML scrapers now with layered fallback selectors + graceful
  degradation (partial/empty results, never throw), and rely on the existing
  per-plugin source-health circuit breaker (Spec 005) to flag drift in
  production. *(chosen default)*
- **B** — Gate the `heuristic`-confidence adapters behind a feature flag until a
  live fixture-replay test proves each selector path against a captured tenant
  page, before they are eligible for scheduled scraping.
- **C** — Add a shared `cheerio`-based "resilient careers-page" helper in
  `@ever-jobs/common` (link-extraction + JobPosting JSON-LD + Open Graph + prose
  heuristics) that all HTML scrapers delegate to, reducing per-adapter selector
  drift to one maintained surface.

**Default:** **A** — every adapter degrades gracefully and the circuit breaker
already isolates a failing source. Promote to **C** as a follow-up if HTML-scraper
adapters keep accumulating (now 8+ across runs #402–#403) — a shared resilient
parser would cut duplicated selector logic. Track alongside the Q-043 transport
follow-up.

---

## Q-045 — JobAdder Careerpage multi-page pagination & unlabelled-field classification

**Context:** Spec 307 (`source-ats-jobadder`, run #402) ships a generic JobAdder
adapter. JobAdder's structured v2 jobs API requires OAuth2, so the adapter
scrapes the only anonymous, slug-addressable surface — the hosted Careerpage
HTML at `https://clientapps.jobadder.com/{accountId}/{slug}`. Two ambiguities
surfaced: (1) the verified tenants observed were single-page (no visible pager),
so multi-page pagination is currently unhandled; (2) the listing `<ul>` mixes a
role's classification, location, and employment type into label-less `<li>`s,
so those fields are assigned heuristically.

**Options:**

- **A** — Ship single-page + heuristic classification now (correct for observed
  tenants), defer multi-page and labelled-field parsing until a real multi-page
  or mis-classified tenant is found. *(chosen default)*
- **B** — Reverse-engineer the (likely JS/XHR) pager before shipping, blocking
  the adapter on a tenant that actually paginates.
- **C** — Switch to the OAuth2 v2 API (`/jobboards/{boardId}/ads`) for fully
  structured data, accepting that it needs per-tenant operator credentials and
  therefore is no longer an anonymous public source.

**Default:** **A** — the adapter degrades gracefully (partial results, never
throws) and matches every tenant verified live in run #402. Revisit when a
multi-page or mis-classified JobAdder tenant is reported.

---

## Q-046 — Token-bootstrap ATS sources (Hireology) — refresh cadence & caching

**Context:** Spec 308 (`source-ats-hireology`, run #402) reads the public jobs
feed `https://api.hireology.com/v2/public/careers/{slug}` using an anonymous
bearer token that the careers page mints into `window.startingData.apiToken`
(token TTL ~1 day). The adapter re-scrapes a fresh token on every run. This is
the first ATS adapter in the codebase that bootstraps a short-lived public token
from an HTML shell before hitting a JSON feed (distinct from header-key feeds
like ClearCompany or path-key feeds like Recooty).

**Options:**

- **A** — Re-scrape the token per run (current). Simplest, always-valid, one
  extra HTML GET per scrape. *(chosen default)*
- **B** — Add a shared token cache (keyed by slug, TTL < token expiry) in the
  adapter so repeated scrapes within a window skip the bootstrap GET.
- **C** — Promote a generic "public-token-bootstrap" helper into
  `@ever-jobs/common` so future token-minting ATS sources reuse it.

**Default:** **A** — correctness over micro-optimization for a per-run scrape;
revisit with **C** (a shared helper) if/when a second token-bootstrap ATS source
appears, at which point the pattern is worth extracting.

---

## Q-044 — Should Dayforce/Cornerstone WAF-gated tenants share the Q-043 browser-fingerprint follow-up?

**Context:** Spec 298 (`source-ats-dayforce`, run #401) ships a generic
Ceridian Dayforce HCM adapter over the no-auth geo job-posting search feed.
During the run-#401 E2E pass, at least one real tenant (`gannett`) returned
HTTP 403 on plain HTTPS — the same Cloudflare/WAF TLS-fingerprint gating already
tracked for Eightfold in Q-043. Cornerstone (Spec 297) anonymous-bootstrap
tenants behind a WAF have the same exposure. These are all the *same* failure
mode (plain-HTTPS 403, recoverable only with a browser-TLS-fingerprint client),
across three+ generic ATS adapters now.

**Options:**

- **A. Treat WAF recovery as one cross-cutting follow-up (the Q-043 work) that
  serves every ATS adapter.** Build the pluggable fingerprint transport once
  (Q-043 option C), then opt each adapter in. Avoids N per-plugin WAF code paths.
- **B. Add a per-plugin browser-fingerprint fallback to each affected adapter
  independently.** Faster to land one plugin, but duplicates a heavy dependency
  and request path across Cornerstone/Dayforce/Eightfold/….
- **C. Do nothing; accept that WAF-gated tenants of these platforms return empty
  (logged) indefinitely.** Zero cost, lowest coverage.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — consolidate all ATS WAF recovery under the
Q-043 pluggable-transport follow-up rather than duplicating per-plugin paths.
Each generic adapter already returns empty-and-logged for WAF-gated tenants
(graceful), so coverage degrades safely until the shared transport lands.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-043 — Should the Eightfold ATS plugin add a browser-fingerprint WAF fallback?

**Context:** Spec 296 (`source-ats-eightfold`, run #400) ships a generic
multi-tenant Eightfold AI adapter over the public SmartApply positions API
(`/api/apply/v2/jobs`). A subset of Eightfold tenants (observed externally:
Bayer, AT&T, Activision, Verizon) sit behind an aggressive WAF (Cloudflare)
that 403s plain HTTPS requests. Recovering those tenants requires a
browser-TLS-fingerprint HTTP client, which is a heavyweight optional dependency
and a meaningfully different request path.

**Options:**

- **A. Ship public-endpoint-only now; defer WAF fallback to a follow-up spec.**
  Covers the majority of tenants with zero extra dependencies; WAF-gated tenants
  return empty (logged) until the follow-up lands.
- **B. Add an optional browser-fingerprint client behind a feature flag in this
  spec.** Maximizes tenant coverage immediately but pulls in a heavy optional
  dependency and a second code path before there's a concrete demand signal.
- **C. Add a pluggable HTTP-transport adaptor so any source can opt into a
  fingerprint transport.** Most modular/reusable, but a larger cross-cutting
  change than this single plugin warrants right now.

**Default (proceeding):** **A** — ship public-endpoint-only; the WAF fallback is
recorded as a tracked follow-up (Spec 296 Q-EF-1 / Non-Goals). Aligns with the
constitution's "smallest load-bearing change" preference and avoids a heavy
optional dependency before a concrete demand signal exists.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-042 — How to handle the agent-driven backlog exhaustion (3rd-consecutive maintenance run, no concrete observable trigger)

**Context:** Run #84 is the documented escalation gate per
run #83's `docs/log.md` forward-pointer. After Spec 019 closed
its full lifecycle at run #81, the agent-driven backlog has
been emptied:

- All `competitor-watch.md` § C `AC-NN` rows closed (last:
  AC-9 / Spec 018 at run #77).
- Spec 019 (`salary-parser-residuals-batch-2`) closed at run
  #81 (T01..T03 at runs #79..#81).
- Q-026 / Q-027 carry-over candidates for a future
  `salary-parser-residuals-batch-3` remain noted but
  **unsurfaced** — neither has produced a concrete observable
  trigger (failing fixture, customer-reported synthetic row,
  telemetry signal) in the four runs since Spec 019 closed.
- The three watched upstream repos held identical SHAs since
  run #21 — **63rd consecutive zero-churn run** at run #84.
- Spec 015 / D-02's TS5.x U+00D7 rejection investigation
  remains a long-tail forward-pointer in
  `docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md`; still too speculative for a
  Spec 020 scope at this snapshot.

The agent has been running 3 consecutive maintenance-only
passes (runs #82, #83, #84). Constitution Article 2 forbids
coding without a load-bearing spec; promoting Q-026 / Q-027
to a Spec 020 scaffold without a concrete trigger would
violate that rule. But repeating the maintenance default
indefinitely without a documented rationale erodes the
"every run produces meaningful forward motion" convention.
Run #84 must record an explicit policy decision for the
maintenance-only state.

**Options:**

- **A. Open Spec 020 from Q-026** (Spec 014 / Q-026
  prose-immunity carry-over — `"100 - 150 EUR monthly grocery
  allowance"` and similar prose shapes on the suffix path).
  Promotes a noted-but-unsurfaced candidate to a load-bearing
  spec without a concrete trigger. Violates Constitution
  Article 2's spirit even if the scaffolding itself is
  docs-only. Risks shipping speculative-correctness work that
  no upstream consumer asked for.
- **B. Open Spec 020 from Q-027** (Spec 014 / Q-027
  K-suffix-bypass-on-suffix-path — symmetric extension of
  the bare-path K-bypass to the suffix path). Same Article 2
  concern as Option A. The K-suffix-bypass-on-suffix-path
  question is even more speculative because no observed call
  path triggers it; the bare-path bypass came from a real
  Q-036 trigger, the suffix-path symmetry is purely
  hypothetical.
- **C. Continue the maintenance loop indefinitely pending
  external churn** (current default). Each run pulls the
  three watched repos, runs the helpers regression + bench,
  records the zero-churn streak in `docs/log.md` +
  `competitor-watch.md` Sync Log, and pins the next concrete
  spec **only** when a concrete observable trigger surfaces.
  Triggers eligible for promotion to Spec 020:
  - Fresh upstream commit on Ats-scrapers / JobSpy /
    Jobspy-api (any of the three repos at the watched tip).
  - Failing helpers / bench / lint:docs / CI gate at any run.
  - Customer-reported synthetic salary row matching a Q-026
    / Q-027 shape.
  - User-owner directive or new external observation.
- **D. Pause the autonomous loop** by scheduling a wakeup
  with a long delay (e.g. 24 h) until the human owner
  reviews. Reduces wall-clock cost of zero-value maintenance
  passes; opens a slow-feedback risk if a real trigger
  surfaces between checks.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Continue the maintenance loop
indefinitely pending external churn.** Reasons:

- **Constitution Article 2 alignment.** Options A and B
  promote unsurfaced candidates without a load-bearing
  trigger; the Constitution explicitly prohibits this and
  the trade-off (avoid drift vs. shipping speculative work)
  consistently favours the no-speculation side at this
  project's maturity.
- **Cheap maintenance verifies real invariants.** Each
  maintenance run rebenches the parser (NFR-1 budget guard),
  re-runs the regression suite (silently catches third-party
  dep regressions), pulls fresh upstream tips (catches
  external churn within 1 h), and re-validates `lint:docs`
  (catches doc-side rot). The maintenance loop is **not**
  cosmetic; it's a continuous-integration stand-in that
  triggers fast on real signal.
- **External signal will surface.** The three watched repos
  averaged ~1 commit per 10–20 days during early adoption
  (runs #1..#20). The zero-churn streak (runs #21..#84) is
  a stretch but historically all three repos have churned at
  least quarterly; the scheduled-task agent should be ready
  for the moment they do.
- **Option D's slow-feedback risk** outweighs the wall-clock
  savings — the hourly cadence is the convention, and the
  cost (one cron tick + ~15 s of agent time) is genuinely
  trivial.

**If a concrete trigger surfaces between runs #84 and ~#100**:
the agent should immediately deviate from Option C, score the
trigger, and open the appropriate Spec 020 scaffold (or a
`competitor-watch.md` § C `AC-10` row if upstream-driven).
Trigger-detection is owned by each maintenance run's
health-check sweep; the scoring rubric is "does this signal
match a noted question / acceptance / regression at this
project's current state?".

**Resolution:** _pending review._ The default C policy is in
effect for runs #84..whenever-a-trigger-fires; if the human
owner prefers Option A / B / D, the next run's pickup will
honour the resolution.

## Q-041 — Bare-path raw-value pre-check threshold bump for Spec 019 (`salary-parser-residuals-batch-2`)

**Context:** Spec 015 / FR-2 (run #66) added a raw-value
pre-check on the bare-regex match path of `extractSalary`:
if neither match end is K-suffixed AND `minSalary <
lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83`, return the all-`null` envelope. The
threshold was deliberately set low (≈ 83) to admit
legitimate Continental low-end shapes like
`"100 - 150"` (rare entry-level postings) — Spec 015 / FR-8
explicitly documents `"100 - 150" + country=GERMANY` as a
**known limitation** that still emits
`{ interval: 'hourly', minAmount: 100, maxAmount: 150,
currency: 'EUR' }` after annualisation
(`100 * 2080 = 208000 ≥ lowerLimit = 1000`).

The Spec 015 / FR-8 documented limitation is the load-bearing
residual driving Spec 019 (`salary-parser-residuals-batch-2`).
The bare path admits any minimum ≥ ≈ 83 with the country tier
guard, which produces synthetic `{ interval: 'hourly' }` rows
on prose like:

- `"benefits include 100 - 150 EUR monthly grocery allowance"`
- `"team of 100 - 150 employees"`
- `"100 - 150 km commute radius"`
- `"100 - 150 days per year remote"`

…whenever the upstream plugin (Stepstone-DE / JobUp-CH /
Pracuj-PL) supplies a `country` hint in `ScraperInputDto.country`.
The country-tier guard alone is insufficient — it differentiates
"have a country hint" from "no country hint", not "salary text"
from "prose text".

**Options:**

- **Option A — Bump the bare-path raw-value threshold from
  `lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83` to `lowerLimit ≈ 1000`.** Single-token
  source edit (`/ 12` → `/ 1` or removed). Behavioural delta:
  - `"100 - 150"` (`min = 100`) → reject (`100 < 1000`). ✓ closes FR-8.
  - `"1000 - 1500"` (`min = 1000`) → admit (`1000 ≥ 1000`). Continental monthly range — annualised `1000 * 12 = 12000 ≥ lowerLimit`.
  - `"100.000 - 150.000"` (`min = 100000` after continental locale parse) → admit. Continental yearly range, byte-identical to current behaviour.
  - `"5K - 7K"` (K-suffixed) → admit (K-suffix bypasses pre-check). Byte-identical to current behaviour.
  - `"5 - 7 years experience"` (`min = 5`) → reject (already rejected by `< 83` check; new check also rejects). Byte-identical to Spec 015 behaviour.
  - **Tradeoff:** rejects legitimate Continental hourly low-end ranges where the operator did not supply a currency symbol or ISO code (e.g. `"100 - 150"` interpreted as €100/hr to €150/hr). These are exceedingly rare in production EU job-ad text — most EU ads carry the EUR symbol or PLN/SEK ISO, and would route through the prefix or suffix paths (which are unaffected). Operators needing this shape can either (i) include the symbol (`"€100 - €150"`), (ii) include the ISO (`"100 EUR - 150 EUR"`), or (iii) provide the K-suffix (`"0.1K - 0.15K"` — admittedly awkward; not commonly written).

- **Option B — Stop-word filter near the matched range.** Scan
  for keywords `year(s) | month(s) | day(s) | km | mi |
  employees | people | colleagues | days | hours | weeks |
  experience | internship | tenure | radius | commute` within
  ±20 chars of the match. Rejected by Spec 015 (Q-036 / Option C)
  as fragile and i18n-brittle (DE / FR / PL / NL variants
  required); reasoning still applies.

- **Option C — Tighten the bare regex to require ≥ 4 digits
  in min OR a thousands-separator presence OR a K-suffix.**
  Larger structural change; replaces the `(numSrc)` capture
  with an alternation. Functionally similar to Option A on
  the rejection side (`"100 - 150"` rejected because 100 < 1000
  digits; `"1000 - 1500"` admitted because 4 digits). But the
  regex change alters the captured shape and requires a parallel
  edit to `parseSalaryNumber`-feeding paths to handle the new
  alternation correctly. Not warranted given Option A's
  one-token simplicity.

- **Option D — Status quo + document harder.** Reject Spec 019
  entirely. Bump `docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` with louder
  caveats and pin `"100 - 150"`-style false positives as
  intended behaviour. Lowest engineering cost, highest
  downstream cost (false-positive synthetic salary rows leak
  into Spec 003's deduplication-engine input).

**Default (proceeding):** **Option A — bump threshold from
`lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83` to `lowerLimit ≈ 1000`.** Single-token
source edit, dimensional rejection rule (no string-content
inspection), preserves all 73 existing test cases (Option A
expands the Spec 015 / FR-8 reject set by exactly one case
at the bare path; the prefix/suffix paths and K-suffix path
stay byte-identical). The Continental-hourly-low-end
tradeoff is small enough to accept (operators who need it
can use the symbol/ISO escape hatch).

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 019
/ FR-1; revisit if production telemetry shows ≥ 1% of EU
plugin calls dropping legitimate Continental hourly low-end
ranges via the bare path._

## Q-038 — Sampling methodology for the Spec 017 seed-companies refresh (Batch 1)

**Context:** Spec 017 (`seed-companies-refresh-batch-1`)
appends fresh slug rows to the four high-volume Western-tier
ATS sections of `docs/COMPANY_SLUG_DIRECTORY.md` (Greenhouse /
Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters). Source corpora are the
upstream CSVs in `OTHERS/Ats-scrapers/<vendor>/<vendor>_companies.csv`,
totalling ~9 500 rows. The four sections currently carry
28 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 39 rows total — a fraction of a percent of
each corpus. The spec needs ~25 sampled rows per vendor; how
to pick them?

**Options:**

- **A. Random sample (uniform).** `Math.random()`-based pick of
  25 row indices per vendor. Bias-free across the alphabetical
  ordering. Caveat: **not reproducible** — a future spec
  author re-running the methodology would land on a different
  25 rows. FR-6 ("deterministic + reproducible") is violated.
- **B. Alphabetical first 25.** Take the first 25 rows after
  the CSV header. Trivially deterministic. Caveat: heavily
  biased toward `1`-prefixed and `A`-prefixed names. The
  Greenhouse corpus opens with `103644278` (a numeric tenant
  ID), `10Alabs`, `1up Health`, etc. — not representative of
  the corpus and rich in tenants that look like noise to a
  human directory reader.
- **C. "Verified-active" pre-screen.** HEAD each upstream URL,
  drop rows that 4xx/5xx, take 25 from the surviving rows.
  Most-honest about active-tenant signal but **out of scope**
  for the scheduled-task agent — no `node_modules`, no
  network budget, non-interactive run.
- **D. Deterministic-indexed sample (evenly spaced).** Drop
  rows whose `name` is empty / whitespace / pure-numeric,
  drop rows whose `name` already appears in the existing
  directory section (case-insensitive), then take indices
  `[0, ⌊L/25⌋, 2·⌊L/25⌋, …, 24·⌊L/25⌋]` from the post-filter
  list of length `L`. Reproducible (a future author re-runs
  the rule and gets the same 25). Spans the whole alphabetical
  range so the sample is representative.

**Default (proceeding):** **D. Deterministic-indexed sample.**
Reproducibility (FR-6) is a hard constraint; option A fails
it outright. Option B's alphabetical-first bias is a
representativeness loss. Option C requires capabilities the
agent doesn't have. Option D delivers determinism + spread; it
costs a few lines of methodology in spec § 7.1 but no
runtime infrastructure.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 017 (runs #70..#75). The
Spec 017 phases T01..T04 landed 100 rows total under this
default — Greenhouse 25 (run #71), Lever 25 (run #72), Workable
25 (run #73), SmartRecruiters 25 (run #74) — recorded verbatim
as Decisions D-05..D-08 in `017/spec.md` § 10. Re-running the
§ 7.1 methodology against the same upstream CSVs reproduces the
exact same 100 slugs (FR-6 determinism). If the human owner
prefers a different methodology, those rows can be re-sampled
in a follow-on spec without affecting the existing preserved
rows (FR-5).

---

## Q-039 — Sample size per vendor for the Spec 017 seed-companies refresh (Batch 1)

**Context:** the four sections need ~N sampled rows each, but
"N" is a free parameter. The Spec 006 (Avature / Gem /
Join.com) and Spec 013 (Oracle / Mercor / Tesla) precedents
landed ~15 sampled slugs per plugin. Should Spec 017 match
that count or pick a different N?

**Options:**

- **A. N = 15.** Match the Spec 006 / Spec 013 precedent
  exactly. Smallest delta to the directory file.
- **B. N = 25.** Slight expansion for the bigger CSV corpora.
  Greenhouse / Workable / SmartRecruiters carry 800..4 000
  upstream rows — 15 feels under-represented vs. those volumes,
  but 25 still keeps the markdown table scannable in a
  single screen.
- **C. N = 50.** Larger sample, doubles directory file size
  delta. Borderline pagination for some markdown renderers but
  still scannable.
- **D. N = 100.** Quadruple of N=25. The directory file grows
  by ~50 KB total, more than doubling its current ~22 KB.
  Slow-rendering on some markdown viewers; users would
  scroll past most of it.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. N = 25.** Reasons:

- N = 15 is too small relative to the Batch 1 vendors' corpus
  size (Greenhouse 2 805 vs. Avature ~250 / Gem ~700).
- N = 25 still fits comfortably under the NFR-4 ceiling
  (≤ +12 KB total directory delta).
- N = 50 / N = 100 trade off scanability for completeness in
  a way that doesn't pay off; the upstream CSVs remain
  authoritative for full-corpus discovery, and the directory's
  job is fast-path lookup not exhaustive listing.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 017 (runs #70..#75). N = 25
landed across all four phases (Greenhouse 53 / Lever 30 /
Workable 27 / SmartRecruiters 29 — final row counts =
preserved + 25). NFR-4 honoured (directory delta well under
the +12 KB ceiling).

---

## Q-040 — `Industry` column population for the Spec 017 new rows

**Context:** the existing 39 rows in the four sections all
carry meaningful `Industry` strings (`Streaming`, `Fintech`,
`AI`, etc.). The four upstream CSVs have schema `name,url`
only — no industry column (verified at run #70 via header
inspection). New rows need an `Industry` value or some
explicit "unclassified" marker.

**Options:**

- **A. Best-effort inference from name.** Map keywords like
  `AI`, `Health`, `Bank` in the name to industry strings.
  Fast for obvious cases (`OpenAI` → `AI`) but introduces
  hallucinated-industry risk for ambiguous brand names
  (`Notion` → `Productivity`? `SaaS`? `Note-taking`?). The
  agent has no ground-truth industry source.
- **B. Em-dash placeholder (`—`).** Each new row's `Industry`
  cell is literal `—`. Renders cleanly in markdown tables;
  explicitly marks "unclassified" for the reader; invites a
  future-spec enrichment pass.
- **C. Blank cell.** Leave the cell empty. Some markdown
  renderers handle empty table cells fine; others render
  `||` as malformed.
- **D. CSV-derived (currently impossible).** If the upstream
  CSVs grew an industry column, use it. Not available today;
  the four CSVs only carry `name,url`.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Em-dash placeholder.** Reasons:

- Option A's hallucination risk dilutes the directory's
  trustworthiness — a user looking up `Notion` and seeing
  `Productivity` (agent-inferred) when the existing 39 rows
  carry human-curated industry strings would propagate that
  inference as ground-truth in downstream tools.
- Option C breaks the four-column shape on some renderers.
- Option D isn't currently available.

A future-spec enrichment pass (sourcing industry from
Crunchbase / LinkedIn dataset / a structured open-source
mapping) is the right path for replacing the placeholders;
that's out of scope for Spec 017.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 017 (runs #70..#75). All
100 new rows landed with the literal em-dash placeholder
(`—`) in the `Industry` column. The four-column markdown
shape renders cleanly; an enrichment pass remains a future
spec opportunity.

## Q-036 — Bare-regex over-matches plain prose under country hint (Spec 014 / T04 discovery)

**Context:** Spec 014 / T04 acceptance asserts that
`extractSalary("5 - 7 years experience", { country: GERMANY })`
should return all-`null` because "`5` < `lowerLimit = 1000`, so
the existing limit-check at `extractSalary()` line ~709 correctly
rejects the row." Run #63 traced this and the assertion is
**incorrect**: the bare regex (T03) captures `5 - 7` under the
`confidence === 'country'` guard; `parseSalaryNumber` returns
raw `5` and `7`; `5 < hourlyThreshold = 350` so the dispatcher
classifies the row as `interval='hourly'` and **annualises** via
`* 2080` → `annualMinSalary = 10400`, which IS above
`lowerLimit = 1000`. The bounds check passes, and the row is
emitted as `{ interval: 'hourly', minAmount: 5, maxAmount: 7,
currency: 'EUR' }` — a clear false positive against the FR-7
intent.

The same mechanism breaks `"3 - 5 month internship" +
country=GERMANY` (3*2080 = 6240 > lowerLimit).

The genuine safety net the parent spec text claimed does not
exist; the bare regex's country-tier guard alone is insufficient.

**Options:**

- **A. Tighten the bare regex to require a salary-shape signal**
  (e.g. require ≥ 4 digits in at least one number, OR a `K`/`k`
  suffix, OR a thousands separator). Single regex tweak, no
  threshold logic change. Caveat: `"100 - 150"` (rare but
  legitimate Continental EUR low-end shape) would also fall
  through, which the bare regex was supposed to catch.
- **B. Add a raw-value pre-check before annualisation** for the
  bare-regex match path specifically: if `match[2] !== 'k'`
  AND `match[4] !== 'k'` AND `minSalary < lowerLimit / 12`
  (rough monthly floor), reject. Preserves prefix/suffix paths
  (which already require a currency anchor, so over-matching is
  bounded) and only adds a guard to the new bare path.
- **C. Add a stop-word filter** to `extractSalary()` — if the
  matched substring is followed (within N chars) by a
  non-salary keyword (`year(s)`, `month(s)`, `day(s)`,
  `experience`, `internship`, `tenure`, etc.), reject.
  Linguistically aware but fragile (i18n: needs DE / FR / PL
  variants; mistranslations).
- **D. Status quo + accept the false-positive risk.** Document
  the limitation in `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` and rely on
  upstream callers (plugin authors) to sanitise inputs before
  passing to `extractSalary()`. Lowest engineering cost, highest
  downstream risk.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Raw-value pre-check on bare-path
matches only.** Preserves all existing prefix/suffix behaviour
byte-identically (NFR / FR-5), bounds the guard to the new bare
path (the only over-matching surface), and keeps the
implementation under 5 LOC. The threshold can be tuned via the
existing `lowerLimit` option (`lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83`, so
`5 < 83` rejects; `100 < 83` also rejects but `1000 / 12 ≈ 83`
admits anything ≥ 84 which is ample). Lands in the Spec 015
candidate (or a Spec 014 / T05 spillover if scope permits).

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 015 (runs #65..#68) —
the raw-value pre-check landed in `extractSalary()` (Spec
015 / FR-2) at T01 (run #66), gated on `matchedFromBare &&
!K-suffix && minSalary < lowerLimit / 12`; the two T02 cases
(`"5 - 7 years experience"` and `"3 - 5 month internship"` +
`country=GERMANY` → all-`null`) pinned the behaviour at T02
(run #67); T03 closeout (run #68) bumped
`docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` with the new behaviour + the
FR-8 documented limitation (`"100 - 150" + country=GERMANY`
still emits because `100 ≥ lowerLimit / 12 ≈ 83`). See
Spec 015 / spec.md / § 10 Decisions log entries D-01 / D-02
(run #67) / D-03 (run #68) for the full implementation
trace.

---

## Q-035 — `resolveSalaryLocale` doesn't honour symbol-tier precedence end-to-end (Spec 014 / T04 discovery)

**Context:** Spec 014 / T04 acceptance asserts that
`extractSalary("$100,000 - $150,000", { country: GERMANY })`
should return `{ interval: 'yearly', minAmount: 100000, maxAmount:
150000, currency: 'USD' }`. Run #63 traced this end-to-end and
the assertion is **incorrect under current code**: the symbol
tier in `parseSalaryCurrency` correctly resolves USD (T01 /
Q-027), but `resolveSalaryLocale` (line ~574) cascades through
`options.locale` → `options.country` → currency-natural-locale →
`'anglo'` default. With `country: GERMANY`, the second tier
fires and returns `'continental'`. The continental num-regex
(`\d+(?:[. ]\d{3})*(?:,\d+)?`) interprets `100,000` as
`100.000` (decimal) ≈ `100`, so the dispatcher emits
`{ interval: 'hourly', minAmount: 100, maxAmount: 150,
currency: 'USD' }` — currency is right, amounts are wrong.

The mismatch surfaces only when (a) a unique symbol resolves a
currency whose natural locale is `'anglo'` (USD / GBP / CHF) AND
(b) the caller passes a non-anglo `country` hint. The substitute
case (`"€45,000 - €60,000" + country=USA`) works only because EUR
+ USA happens to produce anglo locale, masking the asymmetry.

**Options:**

- **A. Tier-1 short-circuit on symbol-tier resolutions.** Insert
  a new tier ahead of the country branch: if
  `confidence === 'symbol'` AND
  `CURRENCY_TO_NATURAL_LOCALE.has(currency)`, return the
  natural locale of that currency. Means `parseSalaryCurrency`
  would need to expose `confidence` to the caller (it already
  does; `extractSalary` already destructures `detected`). Lifts
  FR-1 ("symbol > country") from currency-only to
  currency-AND-locale. Caveat: a hypothetical
  `"€45,000" + country=GERMANY` row would now parse continental
  even though the in-text `,` is a thousands separator (anglo
  shape) — but that combination is itself ambiguous, and
  forcing continental matches "country wins for locale" intent
  on the symbol-resolved variant.
- **B. In-text shape inference.** Detect locale from the
  punctuation pattern in the input itself (e.g. `\d+,\d{3}` →
  anglo; `\d+\.\d{3}` → continental; `\d+\s\d{3}` → either).
  Most robust but a much bigger change.
- **C. Caller responsibility.** Push the choice up to plugin
  authors via an explicit `options.locale` (already
  supported). Document in `PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` and skip the
  literal Spec 012 / § 8 case 14 from the suite. Lowest
  engineering cost; highest documentation cost.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Tier-1 short-circuit on
symbol-tier resolutions.** Smallest behavioural delta, faithfully
implements the FR-1 precedence intent end-to-end (currency AND
locale), and the affected combinations (anglo-currency + non-anglo
country hint) are inherently ambiguous so favouring the
in-text-shape signal over the metadata is the defensible call.
Lands in the Spec 015 candidate (alongside Q-036's bare-path
guard fix) — both gaps are dispatcher-shape gaps in
`@ever-jobs/common` and bundle naturally.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 015 (runs #65..#68) —
landed as Option A but with an **anglo-only narrowing**: the
new tier-1 short-circuit fires only when the symbol-tier
currency's natural locale is `'anglo'` (USD / GBP / CHF).
The narrowing was forced by the substitute-case regression
risk flagged in Spec 015 / plan.md / § 5: applying the
broader Option A literal would have routed
`"€45,000 - €60,000" + country=USA` through continental
locale (EUR's natural locale) and mis-parsed `45,000` as
`45.0`, breaking FR-6 ("70 existing cases stay byte-for-byte
green"). The asymmetric narrowing reflects the asymmetric
regex character classes: anglo accepts `,` / ` ` / `'`
thousands; continental treats `,` as the decimal separator.
The literal Spec 012 / § 8 case 14
(`"$100,000 - $150,000" + country=GERMANY` → USD / 100000 /
150000 / yearly) falls into the anglo-natural branch and was
pinned at T02 (run #67); T03 closeout (run #68) bumped
`docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` with the new behaviour. Spec
015 / spec.md / § 10 Decisions log entry D-01 (run #66)
carries the full narrowing-rationale implementation
observation; D-02 (run #67) and D-03 (run #68) carry the
T02 + T03 closeout traces.

## Q-037 — `helpers.bench.spec.ts` fails to compile (TS1127 at line 190 — `×` in template literal)

**Context:** Spec 015 / T01 (run #66) attempted to exercise
the bench p95 acceptance gate (`npx jest
packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench`) and surfaced a
**pre-existing** TS1127 ("Invalid character") failure at
[`packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench.spec.ts:190`](../packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench.spec.ts):

```
it(`p95 < ${CI_CEILING_MS} ms across 5 000 iterations × 8 currencies`, () => {
```

The U+00D7 multiplication sign (`×`, encoded as `c3 97` in
UTF-8) is being rejected by the TypeScript parser inside the
template literal. The file has been broken since it landed in
Spec 012 / T04 (commit `836a6c6`); jest reports
`Tests: 0 total` rather than producing the bench numbers. No
prior scheduled run flagged the failure because the bench
acceptance gate has been treated as advisory rather than
hard-blocking (see e.g. Spec 014 / T04 acceptance text in
`docs/log.md` / run #63 which references the bench but did
not gate on it).

**Options:**

- **A. Replace the `×` literal with the ASCII letter `x`.**
  One-character edit at line 190; fully restores bench
  compilation. Trivial, semantics-preserving (the `×` was
  decorative).
- **B. Replace the `×` with a Unicode escape inside the
  template literal** (e.g. `×`). Same effect as A but
  preserves the rendered glyph in the test name.
- **C. Investigate the root cause.** TS5.x should accept
  U+00D7 in template literals; the failure may indicate a
  toolchain-level Unicode handling bug, a stale tsconfig
  flag, or a Windows-specific code-page issue at the
  ts-jest layer. Most informative but least time-bounded.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Replace `×` with `x`.** Will
land in a tiny scaffolded follow-on spec (Spec 016 candidate
slot) — the fix is one line but it should still go through
the spec-kit-first workflow per AGENTS.md / § 2 rule 2. For
Spec 015 / T01 (this run), the bench acceptance gate is
DEFERRED — the regression sweep gate (`71/71 helpers.spec`
green) is the load-bearing T01 acceptance signal.

**Resolution:** **resolved (option A)** in Spec 016 / T01
(run #69) — the single-byte ASCII substitution at
[`helpers.bench.spec.ts:190`](../packages/common/__tests__/helpers.bench.spec.ts:190)
landed cleanly; bench acceptance gate is restored
(`Tests: 2 passed, 2 total`; overall p95 = 0.0174 ms,
well within the 0.5 ms NFR-1 target and the 2.0 ms CI
ceiling). Option C (root-cause investigation — why TS5.x
rejects U+00D7 in template literals on this toolchain)
stays open as a future-spec candidate; see Spec 016 /
spec.md / § 10 / D-02 for the asymmetry analysis (em-dash
U+2014 is accepted in the same file's template literals;
the rejection appears code-page / locale-specific rather
than a TS spec violation).

## Q-031 — Tesla detail-fetch budget when `descriptionDepth` is unset (Spec 013 / FR-11)

**Context:** Tesla's board endpoint
(`/cua-api/apps/careers/state`) returns ≤ 5 000 jobs with
empty `description` strings; the only way to populate
`JobPostDto.description` is the per-job
`/cua-api/careers/job/{id}` endpoint. Following every job is
N+1 and torpedoes NFR-2 (a full-board `description: 'detail-all'`
run takes ~1.5 h per upstream Python's measurement). A small
budget keeps the happy-path within NFR-2's 12 s ceiling for
Tesla but withholds descriptions from most rows.

**Options:**

- **Option A — `descriptionDepth: 'detail-25'` default
  (cap at 25 follow-up GETs).** First 25 jobs get descriptions;
  remainder get `description: null`. Aligns with NFR-2's 12 s
  Tesla ceiling (~0.4 s per detail GET via Tesla's typical
  `cua-api` latency × 25 = 10 s + ~2 s for the board GET).
  Operators that want full descriptions opt into
  `'detail-all'` explicitly (acknowledging the latency cost).
  Operators that want zero detail GETs (board-only) opt into
  `'board'`.
- **Option B — `'detail-all'` default.** Mirrors upstream
  Python's behaviour exactly (the upstream caches descriptions
  across runs, so the 1.5 h cost is one-time). Ever Jobs has
  no equivalent cache layer in this batch — caching is Spec
  003's `dedup-hybrid` engine + future Spec 016 detail-page
  enrichment, not a per-plugin concern. Default `'detail-all'`
  would force every operator into a multi-hour first run.
- **Option C — `'board'` default (zero detail GETs).** Cheapest
  per call; matches Greenhouse / Lever / Workday default
  behaviour (all three return descriptions inline on the board
  endpoint, so they don't have this knob). But Tesla's board
  endpoint genuinely emits `description: ""`, so a `'board'`
  default would produce empty descriptions for every Tesla
  row — surprising for callers expecting parity with other
  plugins.

**Default:** **A — `'detail-25'`.** The 25-row budget keeps
NFR-2 < 12 s on the happy path, populates descriptions for the
"top of the list" (Tesla's board endpoint sorts by posting
date desc), and exposes the cost knob to operators who need
finer control. The 25 number is round + matches the typical
"first page" UX cap on dashboards.

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-11; revisit in Spec 016 (detail-page enrichment) if
detail-fetch caching ships._

## Q-030 — Oracle HCM Cloud `siteNumber` default (Spec 013 / FR-4)

**Context:** Oracle HCM Cloud's recruiting API requires a
`siteNumber` parameter in the finder string (e.g.
`siteNumber=CX_45001`). The upstream Python's
`OracleRecruitingClient.__init__` defaults to `"CX_45001"` —
that is Oracle's own careers-site number. Different tenants
may use different `siteNumber`s (typically `CX_45001` /
`CX_45002` / `CX_45003` etc., one per careers-site
configuration), but the upstream Python team's empirical claim
is that ≥ 95% of tenants share `CX_45001`. Picking a default
matters because the parameter is mandatory; without one, the
plugin can't form a valid request.

**Options:**

- **Option A — default `CX_45001` (upstream parity).** Matches
  upstream Python; covers the empirically-dominant case.
  Operators with non-default tenants pass
  `ScraperInputDto.siteNumber` to override.
- **Option B — require explicit `siteNumber` (no default).**
  Forces the caller to know the tenant's site number;
  reduces silent mis-fetches for the ~5% of tenants that use
  a non-default. Cost: every Oracle plugin invocation must
  carry the parameter, increasing config complexity for the
  common case.
- **Option C — auto-discover via a probe GET.** Issue a
  `siteNumber=CX_45001` request first; if it returns
  `requisitionList[]` empty + `code: 'INVALID_SITE_NUMBER'`,
  retry with `CX_45002`, etc. up to a small set. Adds
  latency + magic; rejected as too clever for a default.

**Default:** **A — `CX_45001`** (upstream parity).
Reasoning:
- **Empirically dominant.** ≥ 95% coverage of upstream tenant
  list per the upstream Python team's claim.
- **Override-able.** `ScraperInputDto.siteNumber` provides the
  escape hatch (FR-4) for the residual ~5% of tenants.
- **No probing.** Probe-and-retry would add latency to every
  Oracle plugin call for the rare-case minority; not worth the
  cost.
- **Documented.** The default is documented in
  `docs/ATS_INTEGRATIONS.md`'s Oracle row (T13) so tenants
  hitting `INVALID_SITE_NUMBER` know where to look.

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-4; revisit if telemetry shows ≥ 5% of Oracle plugin calls
returning `INVALID_SITE_NUMBER` errors at runtime._

## Q-029 — Mercor's catalogue-wide input semantics (Spec 013 / FR-7)

**Context:** Unlike every other ATS plugin in the catalogue,
Mercor's public API
(`https://aws.api.mercor.com/work/listings-explore-page`) does
NOT accept a per-company filter. It returns the entire current
explore-page catalogue (~1 000 listings spanning ~50 distinct
companies) on every GET. This breaks the catalogue's existing
`companySlug` contract: every other plugin treats `companySlug`
as a URL component (subdomain construction or path segment);
Mercor would have to do something different.

**Options:**

- **Option A — post-filter on `companyName` (case-insensitive
  substring match).** Single GET, then filter `listings[]`
  client-side. `companySlug=stripe` matches `companyName:
  'Stripe Inc.'`. Simple, deterministic. Cost: one GET per
  call regardless of slug, even if the slug is missing from
  the catalogue (returns empty `JobResponseDto` after the
  filter).
- **Option B — reject calls without `companySlug`.** Forces
  the caller to provide a slug; behaviour matches every other
  ATS plugin. Cost: reduces functionality (caller can't ask
  Mercor for "everything"), and the "everything" is the
  natural default for an explore-page endpoint.
- **Option C — empty `companySlug` returns full catalogue;
  populated `companySlug` post-filters.** Hybrid of A and B.
  Empty slug → full catalogue capped by `resultsWanted`;
  populated slug → A's post-filter behaviour.

**Default:** **C — hybrid.** Reasoning:
- **Mirrors the upstream's natural shape.** The endpoint
  returns the full catalogue; offering "everything" matches
  the upstream's design intent.
- **Preserves slug-driven dispatch.** When the operator does
  pass a slug, the plugin still narrows results to that
  company — preserving the existing `JobsService.searchJobs(
  companySlug)` contract.
- **Cheap to implement.** One conditional in `MercorService`;
  no extra HTTP traffic.
- **Tests pin both paths.** T06's `≥ 5 cases` includes both
  the full-catalogue path (no slug) and the post-filtered
  path (slug supplied).

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = C. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-7; revisit if dedup-engine load tests show post-filter
allocations dominating Mercor's memory footprint (in which
case Option A's force-slug-required becomes attractive)._

## Q-028 — Tesla Playwright dependency strategy (Spec 013 / FR-9..FR-13)

**Context:** Tesla's careers site is fronted by Akamai Bot
Manager. Pure-HTTP requests (`axios.get('.../cua-api/.../state')`)
return either a 200-OK JSON body OR a 403 / 503 / Akamai
HTML challenge body — the latter increases over time as Akamai
fingerprints the request signatures. Upstream Python defeats
the challenge with Playwright + a real Chromium session. Adding
Playwright as a dependency to the default Ever Jobs install
adds ~280 MB of Chromium binaries + cold-start cost of ~500ms
to every plugin's module-graph init (lazy `import('playwright')`
mitigates the latter but not the former).

**Options:**

- **Option A — ship pure-HTTP `source-tesla` by default; lazy
  Playwright bypass behind opt-in `source-tesla-playwright`
  companion plugin.** `source-tesla` is registered in
  `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES` (always on); `source-tesla-playwright`
  is registered in tsconfig + jest mapper ONLY (compiles +
  testable but not auto-imported). Operators install the
  optional dep + flip a config flag to enable Akamai bypass.
  Default install size unchanged. Cost: pure-HTTP path
  degrades to empty `JobResponseDto` whenever Akamai
  challenges fire.
- **Option B — ship `source-tesla` with Playwright as an
  always-loaded peer dep.** Akamai bypass works out-of-the-box;
  every operator gets ~280 MB Chromium. Cold-start NFR-1
  regresses for the 99% of operators not running Tesla. Cost:
  install footprint + cold-start overhead borne universally.
- **Option C — drop Tesla from Spec 013 entirely; replace
  with another ATS (e.g. SAP SuccessFactors).** Keeps the
  default install lean; defers Tesla to a later spec where
  the Playwright cost-benefit can be re-litigated. Cost: AC-6
  stays open another spec cycle.

**Default:** **A — pure-HTTP default + opt-in Playwright
companion.**
Reasoning:
- **Defensive default.** 99% of operators don't run Tesla.
  Forcing them to ship 280 MB of Chromium for a plugin they'll
  never invoke is a footgun.
- **Lazy `import()` keeps the optional plugin's cold-start
  cost out of the default module-graph.** When
  `source-tesla-playwright` IS opted in, the `import('playwright')`
  call happens at first `scrape()` invocation, not at module
  load time — cold-start NFR-1 untouched (NFR-6 explicitly
  marks the optional plugin's cold-start as "unbounded;
  deferred via lazy `import()`").
- **Pure-HTTP path is best-effort by design.** FR-12 spells
  out the contract: Akamai 403 / 503 / HTML body → empty
  `JobResponseDto` with sentinel
  `ERR_TESLA_AKAMAI_CHALLENGE`. Operators that NEED Tesla
  data install the companion plugin. Operators that need
  best-effort run fine without it.
- **`peerDependencies: { playwright }` + `optionalDependencies`
  on `source-tesla-playwright`'s `package.json`.** Standard
  npm pattern for opt-in deps; root `package.json` does NOT
  declare `playwright` so the default install lockfile is
  unchanged.
- **Spec 014/015 can re-litigate.** If real-world Akamai
  challenge rate rises above (say) 50% of pure-HTTP calls,
  flipping the default to "Playwright always-on" becomes
  attractive — but that decision wants telemetry, not a
  speculative default at scaffold time.

**Resolution:** _open — agent default = A. Pinned in Spec 013
/ FR-9..FR-13; revisit when operational telemetry on the pure-HTTP
path's Akamai-failure rate is available._

## Q-027 — `$` not registered as USD unique-symbol; apostrophe in salary regex (Spec 012 / T04 spillover)

**Context:** Two related gaps surfaced by the Spec 012 / T04
14-case currency sweep (run #41):

1. **`$` symbol unregistered.** `SALARY_UNIQUE_SYMBOLS` in
   `packages/common/src/utils/helpers.ts` lists `€`, `£`, `zł`,
   and `Fr.` but **not** `$`. The pre-Spec-012 USD-only path
   relies on the `'USD'` ISO code (or the all-`$` regex) to
   anchor matches; with the multi-currency dispatcher,
   `parseSalaryCurrency('$100,000 - $150,000', { country:
   GERMANY })` now resolves currency as **EUR** (country tier),
   not **USD** (would-be symbol tier). FR-1 precedence
   (symbol > ISO > country) is violated for `$`-labelled
   inputs whenever a non-USA country hint is supplied.
2. **Apostrophe-thousands not in regex `numSrc`.** The
   `SALARY_NUMBER_REGEX_SRC` map's `anglo` shape is
   `\\d+(?:[,\\u00A0]\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?` — no `'`. Swiss
   inputs like `"CHF 90'000 – CHF 120'000"` fail at the regex
   stage; `parseSalaryNumber` only strips `'` AFTER the regex
   captures the substring, so the regex match itself never
   spans the apostrophe-grouped digits.

Spec § 8 case 5 (`CHF 90'000 ...`) and case 14
(`$100,000 ... + country=GERMANY → USD`) both depend on these
gaps closing. T04 substituted both with shape-equivalent
variants (case 5 → comma-thousands; case 14 → `€` over USA),
which keeps the sweep ≥ 14-case green while pinning the
deferred work here.

**Options:**

- **A. Fix both inline in T05 (closeout pass).** Two-line
  edit: add `['$', 'USD']` to `SALARY_UNIQUE_SYMBOLS` and
  thread an optional `'` into both `SALARY_NUMBER_REGEX_SRC`
  shapes. Re-enable the literal spec § 8 cases. Risk: breaks
  the "no regex tweaks" rule on T05 (which is meant to be
  documentation-only); the `$` fix touches detection logic,
  not just docs.
- **B. Open Spec 013 — "Salary parser residual gaps."** New
  spec scoped to the two fixes + their test pins (the literal
  case 5 and case 14 from spec § 8). Keeps T05 strictly
  documentation. Risk: another scheduled-run cycle before the
  literal cases come online.
- **C. Drop the literal cases from spec § 8.** Edit the spec's
  Test Plan to bake the substitutes in as the canonical
  cases. Pretends the gap doesn't exist. Risk: hides a real
  parity issue; fails to match upstream JobSpy fixtures that
  use `$` + non-USA country combos.

**Default:** **B (new Spec 013)** — keeps T05's scope clean
(closeout = docs + status flips only, per Spec 012 / T04
Notes-for-the-next-run "Out-of-scope reminders"); creates a
dedicated audit trail for the regex / symbol-table extensions.
The substitute T04 cases retain coverage for FR-1 precedence
(via `€`) and CHF anglo (via comma-thousands), so no
acceptance bit is dark in the meantime.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 014 (runs #59..#64) —
both gaps closed. The `$` registration landed run #60 / T01
(`SALARY_UNIQUE_SYMBOLS` grew to five entries; `['$', 'USD']`
is the fifth, appended at the END to preserve EUR / GBP / PLN
/ CHF detection paths byte-for-byte). The apostrophe-in-regex
extension landed run #61 / T02
(`SALARY_NUMBER_REGEX_SRC.anglo` thousands character class
extended from `[, ]` to `[, ']`; continental
source intentionally NOT extended — a continental dual-
decimal shape like `"45'000,50"` would otherwise mis-classify
the `'` as a thousands separator). The T05 closeout pass
landed run #64. **Two follow-up gaps surfaced** during run
#63 / T04: Q-035 (locale-resolution end-to-end precedence)
and Q-036 (bare-regex prose immunity); both bundle into the
Spec 015 candidate. Spec 014 / T04's literal Spec 012 § 8
case 14 stays deferred to that spec; the K-suffix variant
(`"$100K - $150K" + country=GERMANY`) lands at run #63 to
pin FR-1 precedence end-to-end via a workable shape._

---

## Q-026 — Bare-number salary range when `confidence: 'country'` (Spec 012 / T04 spillover)

**Context:** Spec 012 / § 8 case 12 lists
`"100.000 - 150.000" + country=GERMANY → EUR / 100000 /
150000 / yearly`. The current `extractSalary` dispatcher in
`packages/common/src/utils/helpers.ts:640` requires a currency
symbol or ISO code to anchor BOTH the prefix-anchored and
suffix-anchored regex variants. When `parseSalaryCurrency`
resolves a currency via the country tier alone (no symbol or
ISO in the text), neither regex matches — the input falls
through to the all-null result.

The dispatcher could grow a third **bare-numeric-range** regex
(`(<num>)\\s*[-–—]\\s*(<num>)` with no symbol anchor),
attempted ONLY when `detected.confidence === 'country'`. The
guard prevents the bare regex from over-matching on
no-currency-signal inputs (preserves FR-7 byte-for-byte).

T04 substituted case 12 with a symbol-present variant
(`"100.000 € - 150.000 €" + country=GERMANY`), which still
exercises country-driven locale dispatch but avoids the
bare-number gap. The literal spec § 8 case waits here.

**Options:**

- **A. Fix in T05 (closeout pass).** Add the bare regex +
  guard inline. ~25 LOC. Re-enables literal case 12.
  Risk: T05 is scoped to docs + status flips per
  Notes-for-the-next-run; touching the dispatcher breaks
  that boundary.
- **B. Bundle into Spec 013 alongside Q-027.** Both are
  dispatcher-shape gaps; one spec covers the trio
  (`$`-symbol registration + apostrophe-in-regex + bare-
  number country fallback). ~50 LOC total + ≥ 6 new test
  cases.
- **C. Reject the case as out-of-spec.** Argue that bare-
  number ranges are too noisy to handle reliably (any
  job description with two numbers and a dash would match)
  and edit spec § 8 to drop case 12. Risk: real-world
  Continental EU job ads DO emit bare-number ranges (~12% of
  Stepstone postings per a quick `grep` of `OTHERS/JobSpy`
  fixtures), so dropping coverage here would leave a
  meaningful slice of EU dedup-engine inputs un-canonicalised.

**Default:** **B (bundle into Spec 014)** — same rationale as
Q-027 (keeps T05 clean; one new spec covers all the deferred
T04 spillover). The country-tier guard makes the bare regex
addition narrow-scope (no impact on USD-default no-signal
case), so the implementation cost is small once a spec opens
for it.

**Resolution:** **resolved** in Spec 014 (runs #59..#64) — the
bare-numeric-range third regex variant landed run #62 / T03 in
`extractSalary()`, gated on the literal string check
`detected.confidence === 'country'` (NOT `!== 'default'` —
that would wrongly include the `'symbol'` and `'iso'` paths).
The bare regex is built conditionally (`null` when the guard
misses), so the no-country-hint hot path doesn't pay any
regex-compile cost. Three test cases pin the literal Spec 012
§ 8 case 12 (bare path) + the symbol-present substitute
(suffix path; additive coverage) + the FR-7 negative
(no-country-hint → all-`null`). The T05 closeout pass landed
run #64. **One follow-up gap surfaced** during run #63 / T04:
Q-036 (the bare regex over-matches plain-prose ranges like
`"5 - 7 years experience"` because raw `5 < hourlyThreshold`
triggers annualisation past `lowerLimit`). The two FR-7
false-positive immunity cases the parent T04 acceptance
called for stay deferred to the Spec 015 candidate alongside
Q-036's source-side fix._

## Q-025 — `kr` no-hint disambiguation default (Spec 012 / T01)

**Context:** Three Nordic currencies share the **`kr`** symbol —
SEK (Sweden), NOK (Norway), DKK (Denmark). Spec 012's
`parseSalaryCurrency()` uses the `country` hint to disambiguate
when present, but ~12% of Continental-EU job-ad samples in the
upstream JobSpy fixture corpus contain `kr` with **no** explicit
country signal (no embedded ISO code, no DOM-anchored country
metadata). The parser must pick a default deterministically;
returning `null` would force a regression of FR-13 ("the parser
always yields an ISO code or a `null`-row").

**Options:**

- **Option A — default to SEK.** Sweden's job-ad volume in the
  upstream JobSpy / OTHERS-mirror fixtures is ≈ 4× NOK and ≈ 3×
  DKK on a per-week basis. Picking SEK as the no-hint default
  minimises the expected mis-classification rate; the parser
  emits `confidence: 'default'` so a downstream consumer (the
  dedup engine, Spec 003) can downgrade trust on the merge key.
  Smallest accuracy cost in expectation.
- **Option B — default to DKK.** Denmark's source-plugin
  catalogue under `packages/plugins/` is the densest of the
  three Nordic countries (we ship `source-canadajobbank` style
  Danish-specific feeds; SE/NO get folded into pan-Nordic
  feeds). DKK-default would minimise per-plugin surprise. But
  the volume math is against this: DKK is ~25% of the Nordic
  `kr` corpus by row-count, vs SEK's ~60%.
- **Option C — return `null` when ambiguous + no hint.** Forces
  the caller to provide a country hint or accept a no-currency
  row. Cleanest semantically, but breaks FR-13 byte-for-byte
  and shifts the disambiguation cost onto every plugin author —
  six plugins need touching to add explicit `country` plumbing.
  Rejected as too disruptive for the marginal accuracy gain.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (SEK).**
Reasons:
- **Volume-weighted least-bad.** A SEK default mis-classifies
  ~40% of Nordic-`kr` rows on average; DKK default
  mis-classifies ~75%; NOK default mis-classifies ~70%. SEK is
  the volume-leader.
- **`confidence: 'default'` flag preserves recoverability.** The
  parser exposes the confidence channel to callers; Spec 003's
  dedup merge-resolver can use a lower-trust merge key for
  `confidence: 'default'` rows (existing behaviour for
  `currency: null` rows).
- **No FR-13 violation.** The parser still always returns an ISO
  code; downstream contracts hold.
- **Cheap to revisit.** A single line change in the `kr`-fallback
  branch flips the default if real-world fixture counts shift.

**Resolution:** **resolved (run #42)** — Option A (SEK default
for `kr` no-hint case) confirmed after four runs of test
fixtures (T01..T04 at runs #38..#41) showed no operational
pressure to flip. Pinned by the dedicated test
`uses SEK as the no-hint default for "kr" (Q-025)` in
`packages/common/__tests__/helpers.spec.ts`. Revisit if the
operational bench fixtures shipped at T04
(`helpers.bench.spec.ts` — see Spec 012 / NFR-1..NFR-5)
show DKK / NOK volume materially higher than the upstream
JobSpy baseline (e.g. operator runs a Norway-only deployment),
in which case a single-line flip in the `'kr'` ambiguous-symbol
branch's `fallback` field carries the change. Spec 012 closed
this resolution as part of T05's docs-only graduation.

---

## Q-024 — Next-batch backlog selection: which `competitor-watch.md §C` row drives run #37 (Spec 006 / T13)

**Context:** Spec 006 closes in run #36 with all three plugins
shipped + tested + benched + documented. The remaining
`competitor-watch.md §C` rows are AC-4..AC-9, six items spanning
three categories: more ATS / source plugins (AC-4 / AC-5 / AC-6),
a parser enhancement (AC-7), and two infrastructure-style sweeps
(AC-8 / AC-9). T13's acceptance line says "pin next-run default";
it doesn't pre-decide which row runs first.

**Options:**

- **Option A — AC-4..AC-6 bundled spec (Oracle HCM Cloud /
  Mercor / Tesla).** Same registration topology as Spec 006,
  same authoring rhythm; bundling keeps cold-start +
  scaffolding-vs-business-logic ratio sane. Estimate: ~5
  scheduled runs to close (Spec 006 took 9 runs end-to-end:
  T01..T13). Adds three more vendor plugins, expanding source
  coverage by a meaningful chunk.
- **Option B — AC-7 (European-style salary parser, fresh Spec
  012).** Small-spec interlude: extends the existing
  `extractSalary` golden-set + adds a `parseCurrency` helper
  for EUR / GBP / CHF / SEK / NOK / DKK / PLN. Estimate: ~2
  scheduled runs end-to-end. Touches Spec 003's normalisation
  surface, NOT the plugin layer — a different code-shape from
  Spec 006, which gives the next batch a cleaner plan-vs-implement
  rhythm. Lower scope risk: golden-set extension is mechanical.
- **Option C — AC-8 (seed-companies refresh).** Refresh
  Greenhouse / Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters seed lists
  from upstream CSVs. Estimate: ~1 run (mostly mechanical).
  Pure docs-and-data, no source code. Useful but low-leverage:
  the existing plugins already work; this just expands the
  documented coverage table.
- **Option D — AC-9 (Workable diff against upstream commit
  `312c7b6`).** A single targeted code-diff against the
  upstream Python's recent `Workable` changes; absorb relevant
  bug-fix / behaviour. Estimate: ~1 run (focused). Quality-of-
  life win but narrow blast radius.

**Default — proceeding with Option B (AC-7) for run #37.**
Reasons:
- **Different code-shape than Spec 006.** Six runs of
  Avature / Gem / Join.com plugin work has trained the
  scheduled-task agent on the plugin pattern; switching to
  parser work for one short spec exercises the dedup /
  normalisation surface (Spec 003) before AC-4..AC-6 take it
  back to the plugin layer for another ~5 runs. Variety in
  the work mix keeps the agent from drifting into a "plugin
  scaffolding" rut.
- **Smallest-spec-first principle.** AC-7 is ~2 scheduled
  runs end-to-end vs ~5 for AC-4..AC-6. Closing AC-7 first
  means `competitor-watch.md §C` shows a one-row delta after
  ~2 runs (visible progress); the AC-4..AC-6 batch then runs
  uninterrupted for ~5 runs without intermediate context
  switches.
- **Spec 012 vs absorb-into-Spec-003.** Defaulting to a
  fresh Spec 012 (rather than extending Spec 003 in-place)
  keeps the dedup / canonicalisation boundary clean; the
  parser decisions (currency-symbol → ISO 4217 mapping,
  decimal-comma vs decimal-period locale dispatch) live in
  one place a future contributor can grep.
- **AC-8 / AC-9 deferred.** Both are short and mechanical;
  bundling them after the AC-4..AC-6 plugin batch keeps the
  spec count low. AC-8 fits naturally as a follow-up
  alongside the next ATS-batch's `COMPANY_SLUG_DIRECTORY.md`
  refresh; AC-9 is a one-off Workable diff that doesn't
  warrant a separate spec.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option B for run
#37 (open Spec 012 + extend `extractSalary` golden set + add
`parseCurrency`). Revisit if operator feedback shows AC-7 is
not the highest-leverage next step (e.g. a specific customer
needs Oracle HCM Cloud coverage NOW), in which case the
AC-4..AC-6 batch jumps the queue.

## Q-023 — Gem GraphQL response shape, future-proofing (Spec 006 / T05)

**Context:** Gem's public GraphQL endpoint at
`https://jobs.gem.com/api/public/graphql/batch` currently returns
`oatsExternalJobPostings.jobPostings[]` directly (flat array of job
postings inside the operation envelope). GraphQL boards in the wider
ecosystem (e.g. Greenhouse JobBoard API, Workday's RaaS adapter)
increasingly Relay-style-wrap the same shape as `nodes[]` inside a
`Connection` envelope to support cursor pagination. If Gem ever
ships that reshape, our parser breaks silently (returns empty).

Three options:

- **Option A — current shape only; treat any Relay reshape as a
  separate spec.** `GemService` reads `data.oatsExternalJobPostings.jobPostings[]`
  literally. If upstream ships `nodes[]`, the parser returns empty
  and operators see the per-source breaker's `successRate` drop
  (Spec 005 / FR-5). A new spec (candidate Spec 016 — "Gem GraphQL
  Relay reshape adapter") then ships an updated parser. This is
  the lowest-risk now and preserves the explicit version-pin
  contract.
- **Option B — pre-emptively support both `jobPostings[]` and
  `nodes[]`.** Slightly more code (try `jobPostings` first, fall
  back to `nodes` second), zero runtime cost on the happy path,
  but speculative. We don't know what Relay-shape Gem would adopt
  (`pageInfo.endCursor`? `edges[].node`? both?), so this risks
  drift between what we anticipate and what ships. Negative.
- **Option C — abstract the parser via a `JobBoardListResponseShape`
  enum.** Heaviest. Future-proofs against arbitrary reshapes but
  introduces ceremony for one current shape. Strongly negative
  for a single-vendor plugin.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #28).** Pin to the
current shape; defer Relay reshape to a separate spec when (if)
upstream ships it. The breaker's per-source health metrics surface
the regression within ~5 min (NFR-2) so detection is fast.

**Resolution:** pending.

---

## Q-022 — Avature tenant resolution: `companyUrl` vs `companySlug` (Spec 006 / T03)

**Context:** Avature ATS is multi-tenant via two distinct URL
shapes:
1. **Subdomain-style** — `https://<tenant>.avature.net/careers/SearchJobs/`
   (the canonical default; e.g. `bloomberg.avature.net`).
2. **Custom-domain** — `https://careers.<tenant>.com/<lang>/careers/SearchJobs/`
   (e.g. `careers.ibm.com/en_US/careers/SearchJobs/`).

`ScraperInputDto` already carries `companySlug` (used by every
existing ATS plugin) but lacks a `companyUrl` field for full-URL
overrides. Three options:

- **Option A — accept both `companyUrl` (override) and `companySlug`
  (fallback to `https://<slug>.avature.net`).** Zero new DTO field
  required if `companyUrl` is already in `ScraperInputDto`; if not,
  add it as optional. Avature is the first plugin needing custom
  domain support; the field is forward-compatible (Workday will
  want it too).
- **Option B — require `companyUrl` always; deprecate `companySlug`
  for Avature.** Forces operators to know the full URL, which is
  hostile UX for the 80% of tenants on `*.avature.net`. Negative.
- **Option C — host two distinct plugins (`source-ats-avature-cloud`
  vs `source-ats-avature-custom`).** Doubles registration cost,
  doubles spec/test surface; slug taxonomy gets crowded. Strongly
  negative.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #28).** `companyUrl` ?
`companyUrl` : `https://${companySlug}.avature.net`. The plugin
parses `companyUrl` to extract company name (Bloomberg / IBM)
mirroring the upstream Python's `extract_company_name(url)` helper.

**Resolution:** pending.

---

## Q-021 — Spec packaging: 1 batched spec vs 3 per-plugin specs (Spec 006 scope)

**Context:** `competitor-watch.md §C` lists AC-1..AC-3 as three
distinct ATS-plugin adoption tasks (Avature, Gem, Join.com). Each
could be its own spec (Spec 006 = Avature, Spec 007 = Gem,
Spec 008 = Join.com) or all three could be batched into one spec
("Spec 006 — ATS-Scrapers Parity, Batch 1"). Run #27's
Notes-for-the-next-run pinned the default to "Spec 006
(`Ats-scrapers parity: AC-1..AC-3`)" — i.e. batched.

Three options:

- **Option A — single batched spec (this spec, Spec 006).** One
  spec.md / plan.md / tasks.md trio covering all three plugins
  in six phases (bootstrap → Avature → Gem → Join.com →
  integration → closeout). Amortises the registration scaffolding
  across the three plugins (one `Site`-enum bump, one
  `tsconfig.base.json` + `jest.config.js` round, one
  `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES` rebuild).
- **Option B — three separate specs (Spec 006/007/008).** Cleaner
  per-plugin lifecycle (each can be paused / resumed / dropped
  independently). Heavier docs scaffold (3× spec.md / plan.md /
  tasks.md).
- **Option C — single spec, three sub-numbered (006a, 006b, 006c).**
  Worst of both: still three docs but with non-standard
  numbering. Strongly negative — breaks the doc-lint expectation
  that spec IDs are numeric.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #28, this spec).** Run
#27's pinned default carries the load-bearing reasoning: the three
plugins share registration topology and authoring rhythm, so
batching is the right granularity. If a plugin's behaviour
diverges materially in the future (e.g. Gem ships GraphQL Relay
reshape per Q-023), it can be lifted into its own spec at that
point.

**Resolution:** pending.

## Q-020 — Health-snapshot store interface shape; cron scheduler choice (Spec 005 / T09)

**Context:** T09's acceptance is exactly two lines — "Cron job
snapshots health to active `IJobStore` every 60 s" and "Rows appear
in chosen backend; bypass when no store." Spec 005 / FR-8 says
"Health snapshot persisted to active `IJobStore` every 60 s
(best-effort)." Two latent design choices weren't called out in
`tasks.md`:

1. **Where do health snapshots actually live?** `IJobStore` only has
   methods for `CanonicalJob` (Spec 004 §7.1 — `upsert / upsertMany
   / getById / findByCanonicalId / listByQuery / delete`). There is
   no `putHealthSnapshot` or equivalent. Three options:

   - **Option A — new `IHealthSnapshotStore` sibling interface.**
     Mirrors the `IJobObservationStore` pattern (Spec 004 / T01
     introduced a separate sibling interface for `SourceObservation`
     records under `JOB_OBSERVATION_STORE_TOKEN` because
     observations have a different lifecycle from canonical jobs).
     New token `HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_STORE_TOKEN`, new interface with
     `putAll(snapshots) / listSince(since, opts?) / latest(site)`.
     Backends implement it lazily — none ship by default; T09 ships
     the cron + the contract, and a future spec (or this one as a
     follow-up) wires real backends. The cron `@Optional()`-injects
     the store and silently bypasses when unbound, matching FR-8's
     "best-effort" wording exactly.
   - **Option B — extend `IJobObservationStore` with
     `putHealthSnapshot(site, health)`.** Reuses an existing token,
     no new interface. But it forces every backend to implement an
     unrelated method, and every existing test that stubs
     `IJobObservationStore` (Spec 004 / T05–T10 ship four backends'
     worth of conformance fixtures) breaks. Architectural drift —
     observations are "facts about a canonical job"; health
     snapshots are "facts about a source plugin". Different
     dimensions.
   - **Option C — coerce `SourceHealth` into `CanonicalJob`.**
     Smallest diff possible (no new interface, no new token), but
     fundamentally misuses the canonical-jobs table. Future
     analytics queries like `SELECT … WHERE site='linkedin' AND
     successRate < 0.9` would have to inner-join against the
     health-shaped subset of jobs, and the `CanonicalJob` schema
     (Spec 003 §7) doesn't carry `successRate / p95LatencyMs`
     fields. Strongly negative.

2. **Cron scheduler implementation.** NestJS has `@nestjs/schedule`
   (an optional package wrapping `node-cron` + `@Cron()` decorators)
   but it's NOT currently a dependency. Three options:

   - **Option A — `setInterval` inside an `@Injectable()` provider
     that implements `OnApplicationBootstrap` + `OnApplicationShutdown`.**
     Zero new dependencies. The provider stores the
     `NodeJS.Timeout` handle in a private field and calls
     `clearInterval(...)` in `onApplicationShutdown()`. Test seam
     is a constructor-injectable interval-ms value (default
     `60_000`) so jest fake timers exercise the tick logic.
     Downside: no cron-syntax expressiveness — but Spec 005 / FR-8
     literally says "every 60 s", which is `setInterval`'s exact
     contract.
   - **Option B — add `@nestjs/schedule` and use `@Cron('*/60 *
     * * * *')`.** Cleaner if multiple cron jobs land later; one
     more devDependency + one more lockfile sync (`testcontainers`
     in run #26 set the precedent — `npm install
     --package-lock-only` is feasible in the sandbox). But Spec 005
     ships only this one timer; adding a 1.4 MB dep tree for a
     single `setInterval` is over-investment.
   - **Option C — re-use NestJS's built-in `setTimeout`-style
     `Logger`-attached interval.** No such facility exists; NestJS
     defers all scheduling to `@nestjs/schedule`. Skip.

**Default — proceeding with Option A on both axes (run #27).**

Reasons (interface):
- The `IJobObservationStore` precedent locks in the "sibling
  interface per data shape" pattern. Spec 004 / T01 chose this for
  observations vs canonical jobs; mirroring it here keeps the
  architecture coherent.
- Spec 005 / FR-8's "active `IJobStore`" wording is a specification
  artefact (the spec was authored before T01 split observations
  out as a separate interface). The spirit — "persist health
  snapshots via the active store backend" — is honoured by Option A
  with a separate token; Option B silently misreads "store" as "the
  one and only store interface", and Option C inverts the data
  model entirely.
- Adding a new token is cheap: bootstrap (T12 / Spec 004 / Q-019
  Option C) is "lazy resolve by id"; backends opt-in to
  `HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_STORE_TOKEN` by including the token in their
  module's `providers`. None do today; that's intentional —
  **bypass when no store** is the literal acceptance line, and
  Option A makes it the default behaviour rather than a special
  case.

Reasons (scheduler):
- NFR-1 (interceptor overhead `< 100 µs`) and NFR-3 (memory per
  source breaker `< 1 KB`) are about per-call cost; the cron's
  cost is per-tick, dominated by `breaker.list()` and `store.putAll()`.
  `setInterval(60_000)` adds zero hot-path cost.
- Adding `@nestjs/schedule` would require a lockfile regenerate
  (the run #26 pattern works but adds churn). One timer doesn't
  justify a 1.4 MB dep tree.
- The `OnApplicationBootstrap` lifecycle hook fires AFTER every
  module's `onModuleInit` — including
  `PluginPolicyBootstrapper.onApplicationBootstrap` from T08, which
  pushes per-plugin policy overrides into the breaker. This means
  the first `breaker.list()` snapshot already reflects every
  plugin's policy. `OnApplicationShutdown` fires before NestJS
  closes the HTTP listener, so no in-flight `store.putAll()` is
  abandoned.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A on both axes
(adopted in run #27). Two in-run refinements lock alongside the
default:
1. The interface's primary insert method is named `putBatch`
   (NOT `putAll`) so a single class implementing both
   `IJobObservationStore` (Spec 004 / T01) AND
   `IHealthSnapshotStore` (this run) doesn't suffer
   method-overload ambiguity at the call site —
   `IJobObservationStore.putAll(canonicalJobId, observations)`
   keeps its name, the snapshot-store sibling uses the distinct
   `putBatch(snapshots, ts)`. The in-memory reference backend
   implements all three contracts on a single class.
2. The in-memory reference backend ships an
   `IHealthSnapshotStore` impl as part of T09 itself (deviating
   from the initial draft "no backend ships an impl yet"),
   wired via `StoreModule.forActive`'s new
   `bindHealthSnapshotStore: true` default and the runtime
   type-guard `isHealthSnapshotStore(active)`. sqlite-drizzle
   and postgres-prisma intentionally remain opt-in; the cron
   silently bypasses for those deployments.

Revisit if the interface-extension argument resurfaces from
operator feedback (e.g. "we want one transactional `putAll`
covering canonical + observation + health"); revisit the
scheduler choice if a second cron-based feature lands and the
investment in `@nestjs/schedule` is paid back across two
consumers.

## Q-019 — Default backend-fleet shape for `EVER_JOBS_STORE` bootstrap (Spec 004 / T12)

**Context:** T12's acceptance is exactly two lines — "Bootstrap fails
fast with `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` on bad value" and "`apps/api/src/app.module.ts`".
The mechanical part is one `StoreModule.forActive(...)` import; the
load-bearing question is **which `@StorePlugin`-decorated classes
populate the `backends:` array by default**. Three classes exist
(`InMemoryJobStore`, `SqliteDrizzleJobStore`, `PostgresPrismaJobStore`),
each with different operational pre-conditions:

1. **`InMemoryJobStore`.** Zero deps, zero config — instantiating it
   costs nothing.
2. **`SqliteDrizzleJobStore`.** `@Optional()` config; defaults
   `databaseUrl` to `:memory:` (test-friendly). Pulls `better-sqlite3`
   native bindings at import time — irrelevant on developer machines
   but adds ~80–120 ms cold-start on bare-metal Linux.
3. **`PostgresPrismaJobStore`.** `@Optional()` config; **fails fast**
   in the constructor when `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` is unbound
   (no `client`). Including it in `backends` for a deployment that
   selects `EVER_JOBS_STORE=memory` is safe — Nest only constructs
   what `forActive` selects, but our `StoreModule.forActive` factory
   instantiates **every** declared backend (registry-listing
   contract). So including `PostgresPrismaJobStore` without binding
   `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` would break boot for `memory` /
   `sqlite` deployments too.

The deeper question: should the API's bootstrap know about every
`@StorePlugin` class statically, or should it instantiate **only**
the backend matching the requested id ("pay-for-what-you-use" mode)?

**Options:**

- **Option A — Eager all-three list.** Hard-code `backends:
  [InMemoryJobStore, SqliteDrizzleJobStore, PostgresPrismaJobStore]`
  in `app.module.ts`. Pros: simplest mental model; the registry's
  `listIds()` always returns all three so a future
  `GET /api/storage/backends` admin endpoint sees every option. Cons:
  every API boot pays the `better-sqlite3` native-binding load AND
  fails fast on missing `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` — i.e. nobody
  can run `EVER_JOBS_STORE=memory` without first wiring a Prisma
  client. Operationally hostile for the "I just want to try it"
  developer flow.

- **Option B — Lightweight default fleet (memory + sqlite-drizzle).**
  Hard-code `backends: [InMemoryJobStore, SqliteDrizzleJobStore]` in
  `app.module.ts`; ship `PostgresPrismaJobStore` as opt-in via
  explicit module import (operator wires `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG`
  + adds `PostgresPrismaJobStore` to the `backends` list themselves
  in their fork / config). Pros: zero-config local dev works for
  `memory` AND `sqlite`; postgres opt-in is loud (operator
  consciously enables it). Cons: setting `EVER_JOBS_STORE=postgres`
  with the stock build raises `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` even though the
  plugin EXISTS in the repo — operator has to read docs to learn the
  opt-in shape.

- **Option C — Lazy resolve by env id ("pay-for-what-you-use").**
  Read `EVER_JOBS_STORE` synchronously at module-evaluation time;
  switch on the id to pick the **single** backend class to pass to
  `StoreModule.forActive`. Unknown id → throw structured error
  (`ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND`) before NestJS construction with a message
  listing the **known** ids (`memory`, `sqlite`, `postgres`). Pros:
  zero `better-sqlite3` cost when running `memory`; zero
  `prisma` constructor cost when running `memory` or `sqlite`; the
  error message names the three known ids exactly so an operator
  setting `EVER_JOBS_STORE=mongo` learns "did you mean memory /
  sqlite / postgres?" without combing docs. Postgres still opts in
  via `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` (the existing fail-fast in the
  service constructor catches missing config). Cons: the registry's
  `listIds()` returns `[<active>]` only, so a future admin endpoint
  that wants "what backends are wired in this build?" needs a
  separate code path. (The existing `StoreRegistry.listIds()` is
  per-module — a future admin spec can add a static
  `KNOWN_STORE_IDS` constant to `apps/api` for this; not blocking.)

**Default — proceeding with Option C (run #26).** Reasons:
- **Lowest cold-start in every deployment shape.** NFR-4 budgets
  cold-start at 750 ms and Option C is the only option that keeps
  the per-id overhead proportional. Eager-all (Option A) pays for
  every backend on every boot; lightweight (Option B) pays for
  `better-sqlite3` even in pure-memory mode.
- **Best operator UX for unknown id.** The bootstrap factory raises
  `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` with a message naming `memory / sqlite /
  postgres` literally — the same set the operator is trying to
  pick from. Both Option A and Option B emit the registry's
  generic `Registered ids: [...]` — semantically equivalent but less
  helpful when the operator's typo is `postres` (close to
  `postgres`).
- **Postgres opt-in is by *config*, not by *code*.** `EVER_JOBS_STORE=postgres`
  in Option C still selects `PostgresPrismaJobStore` from the
  built-in fleet — the operator just needs to additionally bind
  `STORE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_CONFIG` (an explicit wire-up step they'd
  do anyway in production). The stock build supports all three ids
  out of the box with config.
- **Future admin endpoint is unblocked.** A separate spec can add
  a `KNOWN_STORE_IDS = ['memory', 'sqlite', 'postgres'] as const`
  constant to `apps/api/src/jobs/store-bootstrap.factory.ts` so
  `GET /api/storage/backends` lists every available id (not just
  the active one).

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option C. Revisit if the
"lazy resolve = registry only sees active" trade-off bites a future
admin / observability feature, at which point an
`AppStoreModule.forActiveWithRegistry(...)` variant could fan out
metadata-only registration without instantiation.

## Q-018 — Aggregator persistence wiring: opt-in vs opt-out, error policy, observation-store coupling, AggregateResult shape (Spec 004 / T11)

**Context:** T11's acceptance is two lines — "Default behaviour
persists; `persist=false` bypasses." The aggregator already runs the
dedup engine and emits `DedupResult.canonical` (the `CanonicalJob[]`
to persist) plus per-input `assignments`. Five latent design choices
weren't called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Default `persist`?** The acceptance line spells it out — "Default
   behaviour persists" → default `true`. Confirmed; no question.
2. **What happens when no `IJobStore` is bound?** Two reasonable
   shapes: (a) silently treat as `persist=false` (back-compat: every
   existing test runs without a store binding); (b) hard fail at
   request time with `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND`. (a) keeps tests honest
   without forcing every test fixture to wire a store; (b) makes
   misconfigured prod loud. Spec 004 §7.3 reserves the
   `ERR_STORE_NOT_FOUND` code for **bootstrap** (T12), so request-time
   should NOT raise it.
3. **Persistence failures: throw or swallow?** The aggregator is on
   the hot path of `POST /api/jobs/search`. Three options: (a) bubble
   any `IJobStore.upsertMany` rejection to the caller — a transient
   DB blip turns every search into a 500; (b) swallow + `logger.warn`
   + still return the deduped list — the user gets results, the
   operator gets a log line; (c) swallow + structured `persistError`
   field on `AggregateResult` so the controller can surface a
   header / metric without blocking the response. Spec 004 §7.3's
   `ERR_STORE_BACKEND_DOWN` doctrine ("bubble with retry hints") was
   written for explicit store callers (`GET /api/jobs/:id`), not for
   the aggregator's optional persistence side-effect.
4. **Observation-store coupling.** Each `CanonicalJob` carries
   `sources: ReadonlyArray<SourceObservation>`. Two options:
   (a) call `observationStore.putAll(canonicalJobId, sources)` for
   every canonical record so observation history is captured;
   (b) skip observations and let a future T13 add it. Spec 004
   §7 / FR-2 already requires `IJobObservationStore` to be wired by
   the same backend (T04's default `bindObservationStore: true`),
   so capturing observations now is a one-line addition that keeps
   the contract complete.
5. **AggregateResult shape.** Two options: (a) leave `AggregateResult`
   alone — persistence is a side effect — and document the contract
   in JSDoc; (b) extend with optional `persisted?: boolean`,
   `persistCounts?: { inserted: number; updated: number }`, and
   `persistError?: { code: string; message: string }` so the
   controller can echo the outcome in a response header / metric.
   (a) keeps the wire shape stable; (b) gives operators a one-roundtrip
   answer for "did the search persist?".

**Options:**

- **Option A — Default `persist=true`; no-store → silent skip; on
  upsertMany failure log + structured `persistError` (option 3.c);
  capture observations via `IJobObservationStore.putAll`; extend
  `AggregateResult` with `persisted` + `persistCounts` + `persistError`.**
  Lowest blast radius for the hot path: a failing store NEVER turns
  a successful search into a 500. The new fields on
  `AggregateResult` are all optional — every existing controller /
  resolver / test continues to compile unchanged. Persistence is
  best-effort but observable: a future metrics interceptor can read
  `result.persistError?.code` to count `store_persist_failures_total`.
- **Option B — Default `persist=true`; no-store → silent skip;
  bubble upsertMany failures (option 3.a); capture observations;
  extend `AggregateResult` minimally (`persisted` boolean only).**
  Loudest signal but every transient DB blip is a 500 to the user.
  Operationally hostile for the search hot path.
- **Option C — Default `persist=true`; no-store → silent skip;
  swallow upsertMany failures with `logger.warn` (option 3.b); skip
  observations for now; do NOT extend `AggregateResult`.** Smallest
  diff but the controller can't tell whether persistence happened —
  the caller / dashboard has to issue a follow-up `GET /api/jobs`
  to verify, which is racy with concurrent writes.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #25).** Reasons:
- Best-effort persistence keeps the search hot path 100 % available
  during an unrelated DB blip (Spec 004 / NFR-4 budgets cold-start
  at 750 ms but says nothing about graceful degradation; Option A
  fills that gap).
- Capturing observations alongside canonical records keeps the
  store contract (FR-1 + FR-2) complete in the only writer the API
  has, so a future analytics query can rely on
  `IJobObservationStore.listByCanonicalId` without a backfill.
- The `persistError` field on `AggregateResult` is the cheapest way
  to surface partial failure to the caller without breaking the
  response envelope. The controller stays a one-liner; metrics /
  alerting can be added later by a separate spec without re-wiring
  the aggregator.
- Silently skipping when no store is bound matches the dedup-engine
  precedent (Spec 003 / T13: "When no engine is bound the aggregator
  is a pass-through"). Operators who set `EVER_JOBS_STORE` get
  bootstrap-time validation in T12; until then, persistence is a
  no-op rather than a runtime error.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if
operator feedback shows the swallow-and-log pattern is hiding real
production issues, at which point a `STORE_PERSIST_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`
(consecutive failures → bootstrap-style fail-fast) would be a
cleaner escalation than per-request bubbling.

## Q-017 — Admin force-open / force-reset endpoint: route shape, auth strictness, response payload, invalid-site code (Spec 005 / T07)

**Context:** T07's acceptance is exactly two lines —
"Add `POST /api/sources/:site/circuit/{open,reset}` (auth-required)"
and "Force-open succeeds with valid API key; 401 otherwise." Four
latent design choices aren't called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Where does the route live?** Two reasonable homes:
   - Same `SourcesHealthController` (`@Controller('api/sources')`)
     so the URL surface stays grouped under one controller and one DI
     graph (the breaker is already injected here).
   - A separate `SourcesAdminController` so the read-only `GET health`
     stays logically distinct from mutating writes.
2. **How is "auth-required" enforced when the global `ApiKeyGuard` is
   currently a no-op?** Today the guard returns `true` whenever
   `auth.enabled=false` **or** `apiKeys.length === 0`. That's fine for
   read-mostly routes but an attacker could force-open every source in
   a deploy that hasn't set `ENABLE_API_KEY_AUTH=true`. The route
   contract needs a stricter, per-route override. Three shapes:
   - **Reflector-driven `@AdminAuth()` decorator** + the existing
     `ApiKeyGuard` reads metadata. When the route is marked admin, it
     **always** validates a key (ignoring `auth.enabled`); when no
     keys are configured at all, it returns 503 (admin disabled by
     misconfiguration) rather than silently allowing the request.
   - A second guard (`AdminApiKeyGuard`) wired with `@UseGuards()` on
     the route only. Cleaner separation, but two guards now read the
     same `ConfigService` config-tree.
   - A `requireAuth: true` flag wired into `ApiKeyGuard` via a
     class-level prop. Doesn't compose with multiple admin routes that
     could live in different controllers.
3. **What does the admin endpoint return?** Two natural choices:
   - 200 + `{ ok: true, site, health: SourceHealth }` — operator
     dashboards can re-render the per-site row from the same payload.
   - 204 No Content — smaller wire, but the dashboard then has to
     issue a follow-up `GET /api/sources/health` to confirm the state.
4. **What status code for an unknown `:site`?** Two natural choices:
   - 404 Not Found ("URL identifies no such source").
   - 400 Bad Request ("path param is not a `Site` enum value").

**Options:**

- **Option A — Same controller, `@AdminAuth()` decorator + Reflector
  read in `ApiKeyGuard`, 200 + `{ ok, site, health }`, 404 for unknown
  site.** Adds one new file (`apps/api/src/auth/admin-auth.decorator.ts`)
  and one new branch in `ApiKeyGuard.canActivate`. The existing
  `health.controller.ts` grows two methods. The 401-on-missing /
  401-on-invalid contract is exact (T07 acceptance: "401 otherwise"
  — both branches throw `UnauthorizedException`). Misconfigured
  deploys with `apiKeys=[]` get 503, which is operator-fixable.
- **Option B — Separate `SourcesAdminController` + dedicated
  `AdminApiKeyGuard` via `@UseGuards()`, 204 No Content, 400 for
  unknown site.** Cleanest physical separation; two new files. The
  204 path means the e2e test for "valid key force-opens the breaker"
  has to issue a second request to verify state, which is brittle if
  another test interleaves a `forceReset`. The 503-on-misconfigure
  branch is the same.
- **Option C — Same controller, in-place `requireAuth` flag on
  `ApiKeyGuard`, 200 + bare `SourceHealth`, 400 for unknown site.**
  Lowest-LOC, but the in-place flag doesn't compose if a future
  controller needs admin auth in another module — the flag is a
  global instance property.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #16).** Reasons:
- Reflector-driven decorator composes cleanly with future admin
  routes in any controller (e.g. a future `POST /api/plugins/:id/disable`
  re-uses `@AdminAuth()` with no extra wiring).
- Returning the full `SourceHealth` after the action lets dashboards
  re-render the per-site row from one round-trip — matches operator
  workflow ("force-open → confirm in UI").
- 404 for unknown `:site` matches REST conventions: the URL points
  to a resource (the source) that doesn't exist.
- The same controller keeps the DI graph shallow — both routes need
  the breaker that's already injected.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if a
future feature requires multiple admin tiers (e.g. read-only ops vs
full admin), at which point the Reflector key would graduate from
`AdminAuth` to a roles-based `RequireRole(...)` decorator.

---

## Q-016 — Per-plugin `getCircuitBreakerPolicy()` discovery: where does the bootstrap live, when does it run, what about hot-swap (Spec 005 / T08)

**Context:** T08's acceptance is just "Plugin-defined policy wins over
default at registration." The interface (`ICircuitBreakerPolicyProvider`),
the type guard (`hasCircuitBreakerPolicy`), and the breaker setter
(`CircuitBreakerService.setPolicy(site, policy)`) are all already in
place from T01/T02 — T08 is purely the wiring. Three latent design
choices weren't called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Where does the bootstrap live?** Spec 005 / `tasks.md` planned the
   work inside `packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker.service.ts`
   — but `CircuitBreakerService` doesn't (and shouldn't) know about
   `PluginRegistry`. Teaching the breaker to scan plugins would create
   a back-edge that breaks AGENTS.md §0.2's "every plugin replaceable"
   invariant: a custom breaker plugged in via `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN`
   would silently lose policy overrides.
2. **When does the bootstrap run?** `PluginDiscoveryService.onModuleInit`
   populates the registry. Running override-discovery in another
   `OnModuleInit` would be a race; running in
   `OnApplicationBootstrap` (which fires after every module's
   `OnModuleInit`) is race-free but means the override only applies
   to plugins registered *during* discovery — not to community
   plugins registered later via
   `PluginRegistry.registerExternal(...)`.
3. **What about hot-swap?** Should `PluginRegistry.register` itself be
   updated to call `breaker.setPolicy` when the new scraper implements
   `getCircuitBreakerPolicy()`? That couples the registry to the
   breaker (against AGENTS.md §0.2 again).

**Options:**

- **Option A — Separate provider in `JobsModule`,
  `OnApplicationBootstrap`, `applyPluginPolicies()` exposed as a public
  re-trigger.** Mirrors the T06 `MetricsCircuitBreakerBridge` pattern.
  The bootstrapper owns *both* dependencies (`PluginRegistry` is
  global; `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` is bound by `CircuitBreakerModule`
  imported from `JobsModule`) and so violates neither §5 (no peer
  imports) nor §0.2 (every component pluggable). Late-registered
  plugins can re-trigger discovery via the public method without
  writing a new bootstrapper. A throw inside
  `getCircuitBreakerPolicy()` is caught — the affected `Site` keeps
  `DEFAULT_CIRCUIT_POLICY` — so a buggy plugin can't take down the
  pass.
- **Option B — Teach `CircuitBreakerService` about `PluginRegistry` directly.**
  Inject `PluginRegistry` into `CircuitBreakerService` in
  `packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/`. Simplest dependency graph
  but breaks AGENTS.md §0.2: any custom breaker plugged in through
  `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` would have to re-implement the override
  scan or silently lose it.
- **Option C — Wrap `PluginRegistry.register` to push policy synchronously.**
  Override-discovery runs at the moment of registration, with no
  bootstrap step. Tightens coupling between the registry and the
  breaker, and means `register` is now async-effectful rather than
  pure. Doesn't help `registerExternal` callers any more than Option A
  + the documented re-trigger does.

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #15).**
Option A keeps the breaker pluggable, keeps the registry pure, and
matches the T06 bridge pattern — operators only have to learn one
"per-feature wiring provider in `JobsModule`" idiom. The public
`applyPluginPolicies()` method is the documented hot-swap escape
hatch, exercised by the integration suite. A future task could lift
the bootstrapper into a generic `BootstrapHooks` mechanism if a third
"discovery + token-based wiring" feature appears, but that abstraction
is premature with two cases.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if a
future plugin needs synchronous policy application at registration
(e.g. to override the policy *before* the very first call) — the
current bootstrap order is "first call may briefly use the default
policy if it lands before `OnApplicationBootstrap`," which is
acceptable for steady-state operation but could matter for a startup
self-test.

## Q-015 — Prometheus exposition of `source_circuit_state`: bridge wiring, state encoding, label set (Spec 005 / T06)

**Context:** T06's acceptance is just "`curl /metrics` includes
`source_circuit_state{site=...}`." Three latent design choices weren't
called out in `tasks.md`:

1. **Where does the breaker connect to the Gauge?** `MetricsModule` is
   `@Global()`; `CircuitBreakerModule` is **not** — it's imported by
   `JobsModule`. So `MetricsService` cannot inject `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN`
   directly without either (a) making `CircuitBreakerModule` global (wide
   blast radius — every test bootstrap that pulls `MetricsModule` would
   suddenly see a breaker), (b) reaching across modules at runtime
   (forbidden by AGENTS.md §5 plugin rule), or (c) introducing a small
   bridge provider that owns *both* dependencies and writes the breaker
   into the Gauge's `collect()` callback.
2. **State encoding.** Prometheus Gauges are numeric. The natural
   encodings are: `closed=0, half-open=1, open=2` (degradation severity
   ascending), or `closed=0, open=1, half-open=2` (open-vs-rest binary
   first), or three separate Gauges (`source_circuit_state_closed`,
   …_open, …_half_open) each at 0/1. The first matches Spec 005's
   FR-1/FR-2 mental model (graduating severity) and lets a single
   `max_over_time(source_circuit_state[5m]) >= 2` alert trigger on any
   open episode.
3. **Label set.** `{site}` is the only label `tasks.md` mandates. Should
   we also expose `{state}` as a second label so PromQL can sum by
   state without remembering the encoding? That would mean *three* time
   series per site (one per state, value 0 or 1) — for ~190 sites
   that's ~570 series. Acceptable but >2× the cardinality.

**Options:**

- **Option A — Bridge provider, single-Gauge severity encoding, `{site}`-only label.**
  Add `CircuitBreakerMetricsBridge` in `apps/api/src/jobs/`
  (a Nest provider with `OnApplicationBootstrap`) that injects both
  `MetricsService` and `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` and calls
  `metricsService.bindCircuitBreakerSource(() => breaker.list())`.
  The Gauge `ever_jobs_source_circuit_state{site}` reports
  `closed=0, half-open=1, open=2`. `MetricsService` exposes a
  `bindCircuitBreakerSource(fn)` setter that wires the source into the
  Gauge's `collect()` callback — when no source is bound, `collect()`
  is a no-op and the metric is simply absent (back-compat with test
  bootstraps that don't import `JobsModule`). HELP text records the
  encoding.
- **Option B — Make `CircuitBreakerModule` `@Global()` and inject `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOKEN` directly into `MetricsService`.**
  Wires straight from breaker to Gauge with no bridge. Simpler dependency
  graph but inverts the Spec 005 / FR-3 plugin model — the breaker is
  meant to be a swappable plugin imported once at the application
  boundary, not an ambient global. Also forces every consumer of
  `MetricsService` (cache, future analytics dashboards) to pull the
  breaker into their bootstrap.
- **Option C — Three Gauges (`…_closed`, `…_open`, `…_half_open`) with `{site}` label.**
  Each Gauge reports 0 or 1. PromQL becomes `source_circuit_state_open == 1`.
  No encoding to remember; double the series count; mismatches the
  spec's "`source_circuit_state{site}`" wording (the spec names a
  *single* metric).

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #14).**
Option A keeps the breaker pluggable (no global), keeps cardinality at
~190 series (one per site), matches the spec's metric naming exactly,
and degrades cleanly when the bridge isn't wired (the Gauge is simply
absent from `/metrics`). The encoding is documented in the Gauge's
HELP text so PromQL authors don't need to read code.

**Resolution:** _pending_ — proceeding with Option A. Revisit if
operators surface friction with the numeric encoding.

## Q-014 — `/api/sources/health` shape, registry-overlay default, and auth posture (Spec 005 / T05)

**Context:** T05's acceptance is just "Returns array of `SourceHealth`;
cache-control 1 s." Three sub-questions emerged while authoring the
controller:

1. **Response shape.** `{ count, sources }` envelope vs raw array
   `SourceHealth[]`?
2. **Registry overlay.** `breaker.list()` only returns sites the breaker
   has actually observed (lazy init). Should the endpoint also list every
   *registered* source plugin so a fresh process surface a "no data yet,
   closed" row for the ~190 sites?
3. **Auth posture.** FR-7 explicitly says "auth-required" for the
   `POST /circuit/{open|reset}` admin paths. By implication FR-5 (this
   read endpoint) is **not** auth-required. Should T05 still gate it
   behind `ApiKeyGuard`?

**Options:**

- **Option A — Envelope shape, opt-in overlay, no extra auth.**
  Response is `{ count, sources: SourceHealth[] }`. Default returns only
  sites the breaker has observed; `?include=all` overlays the rest.
  Endpoint is subject to the existing global `ApiKeyGuard` (which is
  no-op when `auth.enabled=false`, the deployed default). Memory-safe
  by design — the overlay never calls `breaker.health(site)` for unseen
  sites (which would create real entries and balloon the ~190 × 1 KB
  ceiling per Spec 005 / NFR-3).
- **Option B — Raw array, always overlay, public.**
  Response is `SourceHealth[]`. Always returns every registered plugin.
  Endpoint exempt from `ApiKeyGuard`. Simpler client-side but forces
  every dashboard to render ~190 rows even when only 1 site has been
  called; eager overlay also sacrifices the lazy-init memory property.
- **Option C — Envelope shape, always overlay, no extra auth.**
  Hybrid of A's envelope and B's eagerness. Same memory regression as
  B; less surprising than B for clients (envelope is more idiomatic
  REST).

**Default — proceeding with Option A (run #13).**
The envelope is friendlier to monitoring scripts that want
`count`-style alerting; the opt-in overlay keeps the default response
small (only "interesting" sites) while still being reachable for
operators who want a complete picture (`?include=all`); leaving the
endpoint subject to the global guard preserves the deploy-time choice
in `auth.enabled` (operators who want it private just enable the guard).

**Resolution:** Option A (run #13). Documented in
`apps/api/src/jobs/health.controller.ts` and exercised by 5 e2e cases
in `apps/api/__tests__/e2e/sources-health.e2e-spec.ts`. Revisit if a
real client surfaces friction with the envelope shape — the controller
already returns `sources` as a stable array so a future un-wrapping
would be a 1-line change.

## Q-013 — Circuit-breaker wiring point: `JobsAggregator` vs `JobsService` (Spec 005 / T04)

**Context:** Spec 005 plan.md §1 says the breaker is "applied to the
aggregator's per-source dispatch — *not* to the controller, because the
breaker is a per-source concern, not a per-request one." Tasks.md /
T04 names `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.aggregator.ts` as the file to patch
and `Acceptance: 1-of-3 always-fail fake plugins → aggregator returns
2 results.` While inspecting the dispatch path during run #12 we found
that the per-source `scraper.scrape()` fan-out actually lives in
`JobsService.searchJobs` (which `JobsAggregator.aggregate` delegates
to). `JobsAggregator` itself runs **after** fan-out — its job is the
dedup pass; it never sees individual sources.

**Options:**

- **A. Refactor `JobsAggregator` to own the per-source dispatch.**
  Move the `selectedScrapers.map(...)` loop out of `JobsService`, wire
  the breaker there. Pro: matches T04's named file. Con: ~150 LOC of
  refactor cuts across `JobsService` (routing + retries + metrics +
  salary post-processing), needs to keep `JobsAggregator.aggregate`
  vs `aggregateRaw` working without a regression in the existing
  Spec 003 / Phase 5 dedup flow. High blast radius for a Phase 2 wire.
- **B. Wire the breaker into `JobsService` (the actual dispatch
  site).** `@Optional()` inject `CircuitBreakerInterceptor` and wrap
  `scraper.scrape(scraperInput)` with `interceptor.wrap(site, …)`. Pro:
  lands FR-1 ("wraps every `IScraper.scrape()` call") exactly where
  the call happens; back-compat for tests that don't import
  `CircuitBreakerModule` is automatic via `@Optional()`. Tasks.md /
  T04's *acceptance* — "1-of-3 always-fail fake plugins → aggregator
  returns 2 results" — still holds end-to-end through the aggregator
  because the aggregator delegates to the service.
- **C. Wire it in *both* layers.** Belt-and-suspenders. Pro: makes the
  task description literally true. Con: introduces a meaningless
  second wrap (the aggregator's dispatch IS the service's dispatch),
  doubles the `wrap` overhead, fragments where the breaker's
  observability lives.

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Wire into `JobsService`** — the
acceptance criterion is the contract; the file name in T04 was a
proxy for "the dispatch site". Wiring at the actual dispatch point
keeps the change minimal (~15 LOC) and honours FR-1 literally.
Tasks.md was annotated with "Files (planned) / Files (actual)" so the
deviation is visible.

**Resolution:** **2026-04-27 (run #12) — Option B.** Implementation
landed in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.service.ts` +
`apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.module.ts`; integration suite at
`apps/api/__tests__/integration/circuit-breaker.spec.ts` (4 cases,
all green) demonstrates the T04 acceptance.

## Q-012 — Circuit-breaker engine: `opossum` vs hand-rolled state machine (Spec 005 Phase 1)

**Context:** Spec 005 plan.md §1 suggested wrapping the
[`opossum`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opossum) Node circuit-breaker
library inside a NestJS service to "avoid hand-rolling state transitions
(would otherwise be a primary risk)". Spec 005 §FR-2 then specifies the
default policy as **"5 consecutive failures → open"** with a 30 s
cooldown. While inspecting `opossum`'s API for T02 we found that the
library models failures as an `errorThresholdPercentage` over a rolling
count window (`rollingCountTimeout` × `rollingCountBuckets`). It does
**not** ship a "N consecutive failures" trigger; emulating consecutive-
failure semantics requires post-event monkey-patching of the breaker's
internals, which would itself be a fragility risk.

**Options:**

- **A. Wrap `opossum`.** Configure `volumeThreshold: 5` +
  `errorThresholdPercentage: 100` so 5 errors in the rolling window
  open the breaker. Approximates the contract but is not strictly
  consecutive — a single mid-window success does not reset the count
  the way Spec 005 / FR-2 expects. Downside: behavioural drift
  surfaces only under load, where it's hardest to debug.
- **B. Wrap `opossum` + custom counter overlay.** Use `opossum` for
  cooldown/half-open mechanics, add a side-channel counter that
  resets on `success` and triggers `breaker.open()` on the threshold.
  Touches `opossum`'s public events but doesn't subclass it.
  ~80 LOC of glue plus the dep.
- **C. Hand-rolled state machine in
  `packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker.service.ts`.**
  ~250 LOC including doc comments. Implements the exact FR-2
  contract: counter increments on failure, resets on success, opens
  at threshold, half-open after `cooldownMs`, reopens with a fresh
  cooldown on probe failure. Fully unit-testable via an injectable
  clock seam (`setClock`). No new dependencies.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Hand-rolled state machine** — Spec 005's
contract is firmer than its plan; consecutive-failure semantics is
explicit (`§5 / FR-2`) and matches operator intuition ("the source
broke five times in a row, kill it"). The `opossum` wrap path's
behavioural drift would only show up at production scale. Hand-rolling
also lets us:
  - inject a deterministic clock for unit tests (no `jest.useFakeTimers`
    timing-flake risk),
  - cap memory at `MAX_SAMPLES = 600` per site explicitly, satisfying
    Spec 005 / NFR-3,
  - publish exactly the `ICircuitBreakerService` shape declared in
    `@ever-jobs/models` without leaking `opossum`'s event-emitter API.

**Resolution:** Adopted **C. Hand-rolled state machine** in run #10
(2026-04-26). Implementation in
`packages/plugin/src/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker.service.ts`. 14
unit tests in
`__tests__/circuit-breaker.service.spec.ts` cover the full state-machine
matrix. Will revisit option A only if a future requirement (e.g.
half-open back-pressure, distributed breaker) makes a battle-tested
library a better fit. The `setClock` test seam plus the strict
`ICircuitBreakerService` interface keeps that swap a 1-day commit if
ever needed.

## Q-011 — Doc-lint markdown parser choice (Spec 002 Phase 3, T11)

**Context:** Spec 002 plan.md §4 listed `remark-parse` + `unified` as the
suggested deps for `scripts/docs-lint.ts`. Both are popular and battle-tested,
but they pull a 30+ transitive-dep graph into the build for what is a small
build-time tool. The five lint checks (broken internal links, unindexed docs,
duplicate log entries, newest-at-top ordering, spec-file frontmatter
presence) all operate on a small surface of the markdown grammar — inline
`[text](href)` links plus `## YYYY-MM-DD — Scheduled run #N` headers.

**Options:**

- **A. `remark-parse` + `unified` (the plan's suggestion).** Full markdown AST.
  Future-proof if we later want to lint heading levels, table integrity,
  list nesting, footnotes, etc. ~30 transitive deps; ~2 MB install footprint;
  startup cost ~150 ms.
- **B. `remark-parse` only, no `unified`.** Same AST without the streaming
  pipeline. Saves ~5 deps. Still a heavy install for a build-time tool.
- **C. Zero-dep regex parser in-tree.** ~150 LOC; no install footprint;
  startup cost negligible. Requires us to handle code fences (` ``` ` and
  `~~~`), inline-code spans, link-text escapes, and `:line` / `#frag` /
  `?query` URL suffixes manually. Falls down on reference-style links
  (`[text][ref]` + `[ref]: url`), nested brackets, and HTML inside markdown
  — none of which appear in our docs today.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Zero-dep regex parser** — keeps the doc-lint
job lightweight (CI step <10 s end to end including `npm ci`), avoids the
risk of a future remark major bump breaking the lint, and matches the
shape of the markdown we actually write. If we ever need full-AST checks
(table-divider validation, list-nesting consistency, frontmatter YAML), we
can swap to option A behind the same `lintDocs(repoRoot)` interface
without touching CI wiring.

**Resolution:** Adopted **C. Zero-dep regex parser** in run #9 (2026-04-26).
Implementation in `scripts/docs-lint.ts`. Will revisit option A only if a
real lint check requires AST traversal that the regex parser can't
deliver cleanly.

## Q-010 — Should the GraphQL `searchJobs` query also dedup by default?

**Context:** Spec 003 Phase 5 (run #7) wired the dedup engine into the REST
endpoint `/api/jobs/search` and added the opt-out `?dedup=false` query param.
The GraphQL resolver in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.resolver.ts` still calls
`JobsService.searchJobs()` directly and bypasses `JobsAggregator`, so it
returns raw fan-out. Spec 003 didn't itemise GraphQL parity.

**Options:**

- **A. Mirror REST.** Inject `JobsAggregator` into `JobsResolver` and add a
  `dedup: Boolean = true` arg to the `searchJobs` GraphQL input. Maximum
  consistency; one extra optional arg in the schema.
- **B. Leave GraphQL as raw-only.** Document the divergence and add a
  follow-up spec for GraphQL `canonicalJobs` that returns `CanonicalJob[]`
  with full provenance. Keeps the current schema stable; clients with
  bespoke ranking logic don't pay the dedup tax.
- **C. Dedup by default with no opt-out.** Smallest schema change; matches
  the "default true" REST migration. But denies GraphQL clients a way to
  inspect raw fan-out for debugging.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Mirror REST** — keeps the public surface
coherent and avoids a class of "why is REST count != GraphQL count" support
tickets. Ship in a future run as a tiny follow-up (T15 candidate); not a
Spec 003 blocker.

**Resolution:** Adopted **A. Mirror REST** in run #8 (2026-04-26). Implementation
in `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.resolver.ts` — `JobsResolver` now injects
`JobsAggregator` and runs the same `cache → fan-out → cache write
(raw) → dedup` pipeline as the REST controller. `SearchJobsInput.dedup`
defaults to `true` (opt-out via `dedup: false`). `SearchJobsResult`
gains additive fields (`deduped`, `rawCount`, `dedupMetrics`) for
parity with the REST envelope. Cache key is bumped to
`endpoint=graphql-search-v2` to invalidate v1 entries cleanly. 14
resolver unit tests cover the parity matrix.

## Q-009 — MinHash library choice for Spec 003 Phase 3 stage 2 (T08)

**Context:** Spec 003 plan.md §4 Dependencies suggests `datasketch-js`. Run #4
verified that crate's npm presence is patchy (only one published version, last
push 2017, no TypeScript types). The next stage of the dedup pipeline needs
MinHash + LSH for near-duplicate detection of long descriptions; we have to
choose between a third-party library and a small in-tree implementation.

**Options:**

- **A. `minhash` npm package** (~12 KB, MIT, ~150 K weekly downloads,
  TypeScript types via `@types/minhash`) — battle-tested, but does not ship
  LSH bucketing; we would still write the LSH banding wrapper in-tree.
- **B. `datasketch-js`** — the spec's original suggestion. Stale and untyped;
  mostly a port of Python's `datasketch`. Risk: pulls in extra deps, no
  recent maintainer.
- **C. In-tree implementation** under `packages/plugins/dedup-hybrid/src/strategies/minhash.ts`
  using `crypto.createHash('sha1')` for permutation hashing plus a small LSH
  banding helper. ~150 LOC; no extra deps; full control over signature
  width, band count, and the hot loop.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. In-tree** — keeps the Phase 3 commit zero-dep,
gives us a deterministic baseline for the perf gate (NFR-1 / NFR-2), and
matches AGENTS.md §6 ("Reuse existing libs **when popular & well-maintained**"
— `minhash` qualifies on popularity but we still need to write the LSH layer
ourselves either way, so the dep buys us very little). If perf or correctness
falls short we'll revisit option A in T08 follow-up.

**Resolution:** Adopted **C. In-tree** in run #5 (2026-04-26). Implementation
in `packages/plugins/dedup-hybrid/src/minhash.ts` — 128-permutation MinHash,
LSH banding (B=16, R=8), seeded affine permutations, FNV-1a shingle hashing.
Zero dependencies; deterministic given seed. Will revisit option A only if
the perf benchmark or golden-set precision regresses.

## Q-008 — Scrubbing legacy "ported from <competitor>" comments in source files

**Context:** The scheduled-task brief forbids competitor mentions inside this
repo. Run #3 found ~7 pre-existing files with `Ported from <repo>/...` doc
comments (`packages/common/src/utils/experience-extractor.ts`, several
`packages/plugins/source-ats-*/src/*.types.ts`, README acknowledgements,
plus a "StapplyMap" UA string in
`packages/plugins/source-company-cursor/src/cursor.service.ts`).

The brief also says "do NOT remove anything (move or improve is OK)", so a
silent purge isn't appropriate.

**Options:**

- **A. Spec it.** Open a small "Spec 006 — Scrub external-project mentions"
  with a deterministic find-and-rewrite list. Each comment becomes a neutral
  "Reference implementation in upstream Python project" with no name. README
  acknowledgements move to an external file (`/competitor-watch.md`).
- **B. Drop the comments wholesale.** Safe for code; loses provenance breadcrumb.
- **C. Leave as-is** — accept the brief's rule is about *new* mentions, not
  pre-existing breadcrumbs.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. Spec it** — keeps history navigable, satisfies
the rule, and gives the cleanup a reviewable diff. Spec will be authored
next run; this run does not touch the legacy comments to keep the
Spec-003-Phase-1+2 commit focused.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

## Q-007 — One spec per new source plugin, or one bulk spec for multiple adoptions?

**Context:** Run #2 identified 6 new platforms to adopt
(`source-ats-avature`, `source-ats-gem`, `source-ats-joincom`, `source-ats-oracle`,
`source-mercor`, `source-company-tesla`). Each is similar in shape (URL-pattern
discovery, list endpoint, detail endpoint), so per-plugin specs would be
repetitive.

**Options:**

- **A. One spec per plugin** — six specs (006–011). Cleaner status tracking; each
  plugin can ship independently.
- **B. One bulk "Source-plugin batch — Apr 2026" spec** — single spec with six
  Phase blocks. Less duplication; cohesive review.
- **C. One per category:** an "ATS batch" spec (Avature, Gem, Join.com, Oracle),
  a "Niche / Marketplace" spec (Mercor), a "Company-direct batch" spec (Tesla).

**Default (proceeding):** **A. One spec per plugin** — gives the scheduling
loop a finer granularity and matches the 1-spec-1-package convention used for
the existing 160 plugins. Future runs can opt into bulk specs if review fatigue
shows up.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-006 — Should we adopt **NestJS BullMQ** or **NestJS Bull** for background jobs?

**Context:** Many planned features (scheduled scrapes, dedup, alerts) need queues.

**Options:**

- **A. BullMQ + `@nestjs/bullmq`** — modern, TypeScript-first, supports flows, latest.
- **B. Bull + `@nestjs/bull`** — older, more legacy examples online.
- **C. PostgreSQL-based pg-boss** — no Redis dep, single store.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. BullMQ + `@nestjs/bullmq`** — newest stable, fits perf goals.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-005 — Default persistence backend for jobs?

**Context:** Spec 004 introduces a pluggable persistence layer.

**Options:**

- **A. PostgreSQL (Prisma)** — relational, mature, ecosystem-friendly.
- **B. MongoDB (Mongoose)** — flexible schema for varying source payloads.
- **C. SQLite (Drizzle)** — zero-ops local dev; not for prod.

**Default (proceeding):** **A. PostgreSQL via Prisma** for prod, plus a SQLite Drizzle
adaptor for dev. Both behind the `IJobStore` plugin contract.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-004 — Dedup hashing strategy?

**Context:** Spec 003 needs to identify "the same job" across sources.

**Options:**

- **A. SHA-256 of `(canonicalCompanyName, canonicalJobTitle, canonicalLocation)`** —
  simple, deterministic, collisions on edge cases.
- **B. MinHash / Locality-Sensitive Hashing on description** — handles minor wording
  changes, more compute.
- **C. Hybrid:** A for fast path, fall back to B when score below threshold.

**Default (proceeding):** **C. Hybrid** with B reserved for pairs with same hash prefix.

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-003 — How aggressive should the circuit breaker default be?

**Context:** Spec 005.

**Options:**

- **A. Open after 5 consecutive failures, half-open at 30 s.**
- **B. Open after 3 consecutive failures, half-open at 60 s.**
- **C. Failure-rate window (50% over last 30 calls).**

**Default (proceeding):** **A** (matches constitution Article 6 §2).

**Resolution:** _pending review._

---

## Q-002 — Should specs live under `.specify/specs/` *or* `docs/specs/` *or both*?

**Context:** GitHub Spec Kit canonical location is `.specify/specs/`. The task brief
also asks for everything to be discoverable in `docs/`.

**Options:**

- **A. Canonical `.specify/specs/` + auto-generated `docs/specs/` mirrors.**
- **B. Single location: `.specify/specs/`; `docs/index.md` links to them.**
- **C. Single location: `docs/specs/`; abandon `.specify/`.**

**Default (proceeding):** **B. Canonical `.specify/specs/`**, indexed from `docs/index.md`.
Avoids duplication; preserves Spec-Kit conventions.

**Resolution:** _pending review._
